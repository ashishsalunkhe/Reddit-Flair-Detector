2ywjv0,"A Tale of an old man, fiery writer, his mega actor friend and the mistress. TN politics 101","As asked by /u/crozyguy. Not a referenced, cited post - posting from a mobile in a departure lounge is not exactly conducive to posting. 

Our tale begins in the early 1900's, a young Tamilian Hindu on a pilgrimage in Varanasi spots a charity that provides free food. Hungry and broke, he enters this charity in the hopes of satiating his hunger. To his great shock, he is stopped by a chowkidar who asks him where his sacred thread is? This young fellow, nonplussed asks the chowkidar how a thread is relevant to his being allowed in. To which he is told that the charity is run by Brahmins and for Brahmins only and that he is not welcome here. Ironically the charity was set up by a Nadar (a powerful trading caste), but served only Brahmins.

He wandered around, desperate and hungry. He begged in street corners for a few anna's, he ate from garbage bins. Looking around he saw only misery, povery and despair in this holiest of holy cities. He had come to to Varanasi looking for salavation, he went back to Erode (a city in TN) disgusted with Hinduism, with religion and mostly what he saw as Brahmnical Hinduism. 

His name was EVR Periyar.

The year he got back to Erode was the year C N Annadurai, the founder and father of the political Dravidar movement was born. 

Around 1900, the British started playing their favorite card of divide and rule. Brahmins, who form only ~2% of the population (I think it is 1% now), control the entire administrative process in the Madras Presidency. Judges, magistrates, collectors, professors, university heads. Their influence became legendary, and one that would come back to haunt them 60 odd years later. Britain, to first create and later exploit latent frictions in society introduced Brahmin / Non Brahmin quotas in all seats. The mercantile class (Mudaliars's and Nadar's- think Shiv Nadar of HCL) started chafing under the total administrative control exercised by Brahmins and a couple of them came up with, The Justice Party. The main aim of this party was to lobby the British and ensure non Brahmins got placed in positions of power. From these rather limited orgins. The Justice Party published a manifesto called the ""Non-Brahmin manifesto"" (think of something like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.) which asked for an end to Brahmin occupation of chief administrative posts and to open it up to Non Brahmins (Nadars, Mudaliars and Chettiars primarily).

These three disparate elements would coalesce and determine Tamil Nadu politics from 1950 to this date.

**PART 2**

The young man, EVR comes back home to his beloved wife. She was 12, he was 19 when they first met through the process of 'ponnu pakarudhu' (Bride Seeing). It was a weird arranged marriage. The bride, a fiery young girl by the name Nagammai was in her short life very driven, and took to her husband's causes and became the fiercer of the two in fighting for his ideals and political beliefs. We don't know when or where they first met (romantically), but it is certain they knew each other as she was his maternal uncles daughter. She was betrothed to another man, but young Periyar convinced his uncle to break off that engagement and sanction his marriage to her. He takes up his father Venkata Naicaker's business but his mind is not in it. 

That is when the Gandhi Tsunami sweeps that part of India, and Periyar has suddenly found his calling. He quits his business, takes up to Gandhi and Gandhian philosophy like a duck to water. He felt like he was home at last. Here was a party and leader that not only fought for freedom, but wanted to abolish castes, wanted equality. An apocryphal tale from this period suggests that he used all his considerable persuasive skills in persuading everybody (Friends / Family) in his rich, wealthy circle to burn their Manchester milled clothes and only wear homespun Khadi. 

Periyar worked his way up the Congress ladder, a decent orator, he was actively involved in another movement that gave him immense popularity with the womenfolk of TN. He and his wife decided to go after the Toddy (liquor) industry in TN. These gave him both credibility as well as a platform with which to launch his future career.

The biggest single event in his life happened now. The Vaikom Satyagraha. It was a move that married the Gandhian principle of Satyagraha and something dear to Periyar - fighting Casteist oppression. Now, detractors of Periyar will rightly point out that this was hardly a struggle, and certainly not like the struggles that Ambedkar (Periyar's contemporary) was leading in Maharashtra. This was more of a leisurely protest, that the chief of police himself used to have his meals with Periyar and Nagammai. The truth is being debated even till today, but what is relevant to the story is, he returned home as ""Vaikom Veerar"" (Hero of Vaikom)

At this point, I should point out something very interesting and very unique to TN politics. Periyar, was a Kannadiga Baliga by birth. His mother tongue was Kannada and he....hated Tamilians and Tamil culture. Yes, the person who is even today revered and held up as god by quite a few Tamilians actually wasn't a Tamilian, but one who hated Tamils. I say this is unique to TN politics because, MGR was a Malyalee (Keralite), Jayalalitha is a Kannadiga and Karunanidhi while Tamilian, has his roots in Andhra. This somehow has always struck me as fascinating. Name any big icon of TN history, and mostly they are not Tamil in origin. Why, even Rajinikanth's real name is Shivaji Rao Gaekwad and is a Mahrashtrian. Even other lesser leaders like Vaiko and Vijayakanth have Telugu roots, but I am running far ahead of my story and will take you back to ~1930 now.

By the mid 20's, Periyar was disillusioned with the Congress. For all his faults, Periyar was never in this for power, and he felt that the leaders of the Congress (mostly Brahmins) were being dominated by other North Indian Brahmins and that he wasn't going anywhere. The breaking point was when his resolution for communal representation in educational institutions was shot down by upper caste (mostly Brahmin) leaders 3 years in a row. The Salem conference in 1923 when his resolution was shot down for the third time finally broke his resolution to stay with the Congress.

By 1926, he was done completely and resigned from the Congress and started his defining political masterpiece - the Self Respect Movement.

**Part 3**

In 1909, was born the leader who would decide the template, and write the playbook that is still being followed in Tamil Nadu. Strong Oratory, leveraging Cinema and using it as a propaganda tool and most importantly, creating that cult of personality (though he himself would be aghast to see what it has become today). He was Arignar Anna a super personality and one who did not have political loyalists, but devotees who worshipped him.  He was the first modern political leader to use Tamil Nationalism and Tamil Pride as tools of mobilisation. He continued Periyar's anti Hindi (Periyar had an anti North Indian stance, of which anti Hindi was but a subset) stance and used it as a rallying cry to gain electoral vote share against the Congress behemoth. However, we are running ahead of our tale. To go back to 1930, we see Anna as this youth leader, dynamic. One who turned oratory into a power of its own. The key to his success was a mix of high falutin Tamil and more common speak to reach the common man. Think of Buddha using Pali to deliver his sermons and that is what Anna was doing to  political rhetoric in TN but before he was a politican, he was a prodigious writer, a very popular script writer (of plays).

Anna's plays and scripts had some common themes, anti-Brahminism being one, an attack on the feudatory caste system another. His plays had very unique protagonists, one of his plays had a Servant Maid as the protagonist, and most of these interwove these two elements with the chief protagonist being a Brahmin (or a rich, upper caste landlord). Another one of his powerful plays was centred around Shivaji (the Maratha emperor) and his problems with a clique of Brahmin priests, the chief who was actually played by Anna himself. His plays also tended to play up on Tamil nationalism and Tamil pride and would deride the North Indian as the evil Aryan other. 

By the time Anna and Periyar first met (Iirc inTirupur), Anna was this young superstar, fast rising. Periyar was this grand old man, with impeccable gravitas, a mass following and one who could if he wished play kingmaker in post independence India and he gained this strength via the Self Respect Movement (SRM).

The SRM was to change the caste architecture of TN along with ending what Periyar felt was Brahmin domination in TN. The core objective of this movement was to end the entire caste system as it was practised. Periyar, a prototype of a feminist, also wanted and got women included in his reform movement. 

A key component (and one meriting its one line) and one that has had an impact on TN even today was his reform in the educational system - he said all castes had a right to education, and wanted rich caste leaders (non Brahmins of course) to set up and run cheap schools and colleges and ensure the lowest of the low caste got quality, cheap education.

By 1930, the self respect movement was spreading like wildfire across TN, and this is what attracted political legends like Anna to Periyar. They were drawn to him like moths to fire but and the roots of the schism were visible, even in these heydays of the SRM. 

Periyar did not believe in political power, he wanted to play the game from outside the system. His acolytes (chiefly Anna) believed that any such social reform movement should aim to capture power from the 'outsider' (Brahmin / North Indian) Congress and reform the system from within. To use a modern example, the exact same differences of opinion between Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal inflicted Periyar and Anna.

For the time being though, their interests (anti Brahminism, Dravidian/Tamil pride, social justice and reform) initially aligned spectacularly well. Their forces combined, and just when the SRM was slowing down (by 1936 it had been around for close to a decade) in fervour, C Rajaji (the Congress leader in TN and another stalwart) handed Periyar and Anna a second wind.

In August 1937, Rajaji made the fatal flaw (and one that would cost him his government) of making Hindi mandatory in schools across TN. This was precisely the platform Periyar, and more importantly, Anna wanted and they had it.

3huilc,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs","#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki.

f9outu,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

fnfnh1,"There's something VERY FISHY going on with Covid-19 testing kits in India. Prima facie, it reeks of corruption & favoritism in a pandemic.","On 20th March, 18 firms got permission from govt. to get their testing kits validated by National Institute of Virology.

Meanwhile, a day earlier on 19th, Gujarat-based firm CoSara had already received an approval to start manufacturing Covid-19 test kits. This firm is a collaboration between a US-based company & an Ahmedabad-based firm.

CoSara's kits already have US FDA approval.

Some of the other 18 firms who were waiting to get their Covid-19 test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of 400-500 per kit (far cheaper than imported ones). 

CoSara, on the other hand, refused to publicly divulge the cost of their Covid-19 kits.

Suddenly, on 21st March, the Health Ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct Covid-19 tests. The cost of these is capped at a whopping 4500 rupees.

These guidelines have one caveat - ONLY testing kits approved by US FDA/European CE can be used.

That means ONLY kits manufactured by Ahmedabad-based CoSara can be used for Covid-19 testing.

So after allowing 18 firms to test their kits for production, the Modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines to favor ONLY 1 Ahmedabad company (whose testing kit cost is unknown).

Why is a Gujarat-based firm being provided a monopoly on Covid-19 testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight?

Why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines?

Update: Now the health ministry in its press conference today has said, that US FDA and EU CE approval aren't mandatory. So, now Roche and CoSara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits. But the question remains why they haven't validated others as well. Either reject their application or accept it, why sit on it when test kits are badly needed.

g76o5f,The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.,"TLDR: My (unqualified) opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the anti-muslim appraoch the government has championed.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

g7ctdc,"[Drama] Richa Chadha shared an old tweet screenshot of Rishi Bagree (BJP IT cell worker) accepting that he spreads propaganda for BJP daily, which he claimed was a fake tweet and threatened her with a legal defamation case. Later it was found that the fake tweet is indeed real and was tweeted by him","Going to be a long story but worth the drama (i guess) if you are bored. 

TLDR: Richa Chadha shared an old tweet picture of a BJP IT cell worker which says that his daily work is spreading propaganda on twitter. The IT cell employee claims it as a fake tweet and threatens to file a defamation case. But, after a few hours, Twitter users prove that the tweet was indeed real. Instead of accepting his mistake, he is now trying to mud-sling those people by creating morphed tweets.

So, Richa Chadha and few others [shared](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWW4A-aUYAE5iuF.jpg) a picture of Rishi Bagree's tweet on July 10th 2016. The tweet says 

""Dear @AmitShah 
We spend almost 5-6 hrs/daily defending BJP
Ignoring our Family
Ignoring our health

& now a BJP min is branding us as TROLL""

A little background regarding the tweet, on July 8th 2016, Maneka Gandhi (then BJP minister) [approached IT Ministry to deal with abusive trolls](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maneka-gandhi-social-media-bullies-beware-maneka-gandhi-war-on-trolls-328121-2016-07-08). It is [said](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm-0gNCXYAEG5Tx.jpg) that she has given a list of abusive twitter (and FB) users to twitter India (and FB India) and asked them to block such users. There were some reports that the list included some of the BJP IT cell members. And that caused outrage among the BJP IT cell members, leading to tweets such [like this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnFtYhGWEAAO0n1.jpg) from rishi (notice the date, just two days after Maneka's attack on abusive users).

After 4 years, some people found that tweet to be funny and shared it on twitter, Richa Chadha did the same. Then came the moron Bagree with [absurd reasons](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253611143282622465) claiming the tweet she shared is fake and [threatened](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253624497644552192) her for legal action if she didn't apologize to him. She then [apologized](https://twitter.com/RichaChadha/status/1253623633756520449) and deleted the shared tweet. Without knowing the truth, as usual, bhakts jumped the bandwagon of bullying her and even asked the moron rishi to ""not leave her"" wtf?

Then few twitter users proved that the tweet is not fake and the moron tweeted that for real [Proof 1](https://twitter.com/andh_bhakth_/status/1253628890200698880) [Proof 2](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1253678202926424064) [Proof 3](https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1253702288419336198) [Proof 4](https://twitter.com/CatWomaniya/status/1253724299464265733).

Then the fellow bhakts came to bagree's help. [Here's](https://twitter.com/choga_don/status/1253704087046107136) one moron trying his hand at Microsoft paint, trying to mud-sling Richa and bagree retweeted it (deleted later, can't find the link rn). I mean how illiterate and idiotic one must be to not believe the proofs given and still hate people for telling the truth?

This is how propaganda works, guys, even if you debunk the fake news and present them with the facts, they are gonna abuse you and peddle fake news defaming you.

fva9mi,Missing Dr. Manmohan Singh 😞,"TLDR - Singh is King


Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

Uttarakhand workers in Ahmedabad were then duped of Rs. 18000 and stranded midway when they tried to use these buses to return home.","Link to the story: https://www.bhaskar.com/db-original/news/amit-shah-vijay-rupani-latest-updates-on-gujarat-pilgrims-return-from-haridwar-rishikesh-over-coronavirus-lockdown-127094521.html

Since the story is in Hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by Dainik Bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

futac9,Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid.,"First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

g44szk,"Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi, lets's see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state.","###Adhir Chowdhury, Congress


I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 


###Dilip Ghosh, BJP

Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

>Prime Minister of India 

>Dear Prime Minister, I would like to convey to you my solidarity along with that of millions of Congress party workers at this time of immense humanitarian crisis. We are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps the government is taking to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in India. 

>The world has been forced to take immediate, severe measures to contain the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus and India is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. I must urge you to seriously consider the potentially devastating impact a nationwide lockdown would have on our people, our society and our economy. 

>It is critical for us to understand that India's conditions are unique. We may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. The number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the Covid-19 virus. 

>It is important that the government consider a more nuanced and targeted approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration. Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of their proximity to older people.

> Millions of India’s elderly live in villages. A complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. This will result in a catastrophic loss of life. 

>We must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. The financial package announced by the government is a good first step. But speedy delivery of the package is important. Please announce and enforce a clear roadmap with dates for its implementation. Large population centres will require equally large, dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators. It is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the necessary equipment as fast as is humanly possible. At the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out and get an accurate picture of the virus’s spread in order to contain it. 

>The government’s sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. Thousands of migrant workers have been forced to leave their rented homes as they are unable to pay rent. It is important that the government intervenes and provide them money for their rent immediately. Factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk to their villages and are stranded at various state borders. They are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. They are struggling to seek refuge as they march to reach far-away homes. It is important that we help them find shelter and inject money directly into their bank accounts to help them survive these arduous next few months. 

>It is also critical that we set up a defensive wall around our key financial and strategic institutions to protect them from the shock wave that is bound to come as the true impact of the virus and our economic shutdown hits us a few weeks from now. Our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. It is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action. 

>We stand together with the government in fighting and overcoming this tremendous challenge. 

>With best wishes, Rahul Gandhi

I isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
What’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. They call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “TJ ke bare mein suna apne?

From 2004 to 2014- Central Minister

Since last Year- Not MP, Because he lost an election. 

So have can you say that Congress haven't given anything to Scindia.

He supported abrogation of Art 370 & didn't stand firm with his party's opinion along lines of democratic morals.

He couldn't survive 1 year without power. Surviving without position and power is an important trait of leadership. Some who lack ideology can't survive without it even for one year.

Scindia only has about 20 MLAs with him while Kamal Nath has over 90 MLAs supporting him. Why should Scindia have been made a CM over Kamal Nath.

fcfe80,So you voted for the BJP because you didn't see a choice...,"So you voted for the BJP because you didn't see a choice. The INC is the party of corruption and dynasts.

Now there are attacks on Muslims in the name of cow protection but those are just isolated incidents. Jayant Sinha, one of the suave US educated faces garlands them but, after all, they haven't been convicted.

Then comes demonetization but it didn't affect you. So what if it dropped the GDP by 2 points; they meant well, it has laid the foundation for our prosperity. GST came along and, sure a few (many) people complained because it was tough for small business, but it is a great idea and it would be churlish to point out that implementation is part of a government's responsibility.

Then came the ED/CBI raids but clearly those raided were guilty and it is just a coincidence that only opponents were targeted. The EC makes decisions that somehow always favor the BJP but we are used to that. Important statistics are hidden but we don't trust statistics anyway and Amitabh Kant tells us that everything is fine.

Now come the elections and you vote for the BJP again because Rahul. Doesn't matter that Sadhvi, Tejasvi and Ananthkumar Hegde are standing. Doesn't matter that the bigotry extends up to the top, it's an election and the goal is to win the election.

We pass over 370 because why should we care what the Kashmiris think? They will be better off in the long run even if we have to turn the state into a prison for a year. And the students should be focusing on their studies. Admittedly, they were in the library when the police stormed in but students have to understand that we are paying for their education.

Now comes CAA but it doesn't apply to citizens and even if it mentions every religion except Islam, it is a positive measure because we should welcome refugees. Even though Amit Shah laid out the timeline, NRC has not yet been notified and so why should we worry about something that has not been notified yet. Let CAA go and then we'll make sure that no citizen is affected. It's not clear yet how we identify citizens (or perhaps it is clear) but we will make sure that no citizen is affected. After all, Modi and Shah have assured us that no one has to be worried.

Now come the riots in Delhi but there was clearly violence on both sides. Alright more Muslim businesses and homes were burnt but they have to learn that we voted this government in and they can't hold up a parliamentary democracy by protesting, even if they are peaceful.

Aaj cringe story time

10th class Chemistry Lab

It was the end of the session and the teachers were also chilled out. So the lab in-charge that day just started chatting with the class. 

He asked what 'talents' we had and if someone wanted to show them, then go on

Basically he was the indian parents who force a child to play keyboard in front pf guests because they can't entertain the guests like adults 

I was into poetry writing and my friends used to praise my English poems.

So they all cheered for me to recite my latest creation. It was titled- The last  day of Autumn.

The poem was cringe af. Full of errors. Nowhere near good. Those fuckers just wanted to humiliate me in front of the whole class.

As I was walking towards the black board, one girl said - I didn't know you used to write Samay. Cool.

Confidence booster. 

So I started reciting it and within seconds the cheering and awws turned to laughter. Roaring laughter.

That too from the teacher.

As I went back to my place, the girl said - Now I think I know why we didn't know...

Since that day I haven't even tried my hand in English poetry.

g2eicl,Is my dream of being a photographer a meaningless one in India?,"I am a Btech student, going to pass his final year. Amidst the pandemic scenes, I lost my campus placement. I was not interested in it anyway as I hated the course I took with all my heart(Computer Science). I took it as I didn't have much knowledge about ny future after higher secondaries and everyone said taking computer science would land me a job.

I regret this decision more than anything in my life.

I find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. My parents and friends always used to say I have an artistic mind. I draw a lot too, good pictures also.

Then I got into photography, I take a lot of photos and still do. Have won 2-3 local photography contests. But never invested in it because I never got time to do so.

Also I never knew how to get into this photography field? I don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

By photography I mean wildlife, landscape, etc. I wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. I really wont care about the salary very much as atleast I would love what I'm doing. The thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

I need help and advice. Do I need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? Please help me in anyway you can.

fv9ifd,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why","Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",False,ringtring,Policy/Economy,386,2020-04-05 20:19:55,56,0,This is a great point! Thanks for the addition /u/noob_finger2 ! ,,True,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/

g5w347,We wrote to NCRB and MHA requesting them to halt their ongoing National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) project.,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7f60yfc3dbu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=295bf3a056f250df993c0705d5545d303816e197

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

**Tl; dr**

In today’s speech announcing the extension of India’s national lockdown till 3rd May, 2020 the country’s Prime Minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***Aarogya Setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**Background**

On April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called,  “[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.

IFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s *Trace Together* application, MIT’s *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.

**What is Contact Tracing?**

According to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**What’s the Risk?**   


With the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief,  most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**How to prevent these risks?**

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices
3. This data must be encrypted
4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. Strict limits  (in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**

https://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

Consider the following aspects.

**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

In other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

In India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

To protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**

1. Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there’s India which uses both**.
2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

**No Transparency leads to discretion**

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

Similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**No Accountability and No Auditability**

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

Second, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**

Finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

Finally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**Conclusion**

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

Bihar government issued made it mandatory to have new pass issued from DM for new lockdown. The order was withdrawn as shown in the circular below as well as news clippings. My father had old pass from 1st part of lockdown since new one wasn't issued due to holiday yesterday and order being withdrawn by the government. Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

## Tl;dr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India.  This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

We devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing.  To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It's possible if we try!

## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

However, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.

Recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## Overview of the working paper

This [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

Finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

## We have three primary objectives from this working paper

*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.

*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don't have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

Now with utter savage destruction of Indian markets, most people trusting this govt to make sound economic policies will absolutely get rekt.

Yet Minister of State of Finance Anurag Thakur says ""no impact on Economy"". Nirmala doesn't care as she doesn't invest in stocks. Modi is fakir aadmi. Unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts.

Not only has yes bank failed but with Supreme court order on Vodafone AGR dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of NPAs on top banks, including SBI and IndusInd. It wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

Moreover Vodafone a large international company failing due to GOI greed will be death knell of foreign investments into India. Imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. This govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly.

Even liquid funds are crashing hard as even GOI defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. Lot of RBI money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by DeMo, GST, saving private banks, etc. While other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to Indian citizens.


During recession, you need actual economists like Manmohan Singh and Raghuram Rajan steering the ship, not war mongers like Anurag Thakur and Nirmala tai.

fuomw7,India's internet shutdown laws must be reformed!,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zy87u6z1uqq41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b456dedb4224dca0f38034a8c4be6011624aaf

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### Background

On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework.  The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.

The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   


### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications

We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*

Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.

# Tl;dr

IFF wrote to the Jammu and Kashmir Government and Ministry of Home Affairs seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Kashmir during the COVID 19 crisis. The region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 August 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. Therefore, immediate restoration of 4G internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.

# Free and Open Internet for All

&#x200B;

[\(Screenshot of ToI's tweet before it was deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfb2xn7mkyo41.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed515e7a9ee26e760826e15eb81d154e0395548c)

&#x200B;

Yesterday, the Times of India tweeted that 4G internet services had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another [**article**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fake-alert-order-claiming-4g-internet-to-be-restored-in-jammu-alone-is-fake/articleshow/74814962.cms) about this information being false. This led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

While the rest of India transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest COVID 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2G speed in Jammu and Kashmir.  Jammu and Kashmir already has 7 confirmed COVID 19 cases. With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives.  

# Dashboards and Chatbots for All

While responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health’s COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.

# Telemedicine for All

The difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.

Healthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. Therefore, depriving the people of Jammu and Kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the Government must immediately restore 4G services to reduce suffering and loss of life.

But I hear people comparing this country's bailout with that country's stimulus package and it's a horrible metric to be judging a country's fiscal astuteness on.

At least right side up.

Turn the metric around. The smaller the amount of money the government prints the better it is for the country. Every country that printed free money went broke. Zimbabwe, Iran, Venezuela, Japan is heading there as we speak. America is going to have to go to war to make up for this hit its economy is going to take, that's a given.

funp0c,We are facing one of the most challenging times in human history. We are facing one of the most severe medical crises since WW1 which will have economic effects that may rival or exceed the great depression. In such a time there is global deffecit of leadership from Modi in India to Trump in America,"There is a global crises of leadership. Under Trump and his America first policy, America has receded from the world stage leaving space for China, space which China used to gain influence over the WHO, the current chief of the WHO always had a favourable standing with China, with his rival for the chairmanship of the WHO Dr David Nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current WHO chief has close contacts with China and it's leadership. These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage. Trump also took the Corona Virus very very lightly, downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies, he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies, for example Russia's interference in US elections and the Khashguni murders. 

Now coming to India, no political party in India has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two AIIMS. This is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. Currently India has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. I'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to AYUSH doctors.

When the Delhi state government, started to build Mohalla Clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the D.D.A, which is controlled by the Central Government, didn't alot them any land, forcing Mohalla Clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. As they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. Now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.

The question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in Hungary.

Edit: I would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in India also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in India, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the Supreme Court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having Covid19. Couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

Edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of N95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. In fact a shipment of N95 which was just transiting through a U.S. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to Germany.

Is Trump crazy, he is isolating America and Americans at their time of greatest needs. For example Germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of Ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? Canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from Windsor Ontario to North American cities like Detroit.

For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 

Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they don’t show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 

So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 

I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldn’t get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 

I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 

I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 

As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself can’t curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

I was confused as to what vaccine, because I thought there isn't a vaccine yet. They were saying  it was recommended by the  government and everyone is  taking it to be safe and I should take it too. They then told me it’s a homeopathic medicine that everyone is taking to be safe from corona virus. Its called Ars Alb 30. A homeopathic medicine based on Arsenic Album. I laughed it off and told them its all stupid whatsapp forwards and homepathy doesn’t work etc etc and didn't bother much about it. 

But, my sister recently had a baby and when I met her MIL she gave me a packet telling me they were medicines for my sister. I gave them to my sis and she asked my why I am giving her [this](https://i.imgur.com/qVKmkZQ.png). I was baffled and eventually realized this was the ""corona vaccine"".

fzs3p8,An Honest Conversation About Demonetization,"***Long Post Warning***

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* Poor were left unbanked and were left in the lurch. They suffered significantly.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post.

fyawr9,"The need to investigate the NSO Group, which was behind the Pegasus software, is now more than ever.","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

fprst3,Delhi Police admits to using drones on civilians without any publicly available legal guidelines in place,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bek5rixn5p41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca65e50744218eb0cb5f97c4f4813e00518bd35

**Tl;dr**

With reports now emerging that the Delhi Police is using drones to check for people who are breaking the curfew in Delhi, we examine responses we have received in reply to Right to Information requests filed about the usage of drones in Delhi in February. The Delhi Police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections and during the riots in North-East Delhi. This is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.  


**Wait… What?**

The Delhi Police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. The first [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/anti-caa-stir-delhi-police-use-drone-to-keep-track-of-protesters-1629729-2019-12-19) emerged in December, 2019 when it was reported that anti-CAA protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. This was in addition to the Delhi Police’s use of [**Fa**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/)[**cial Recognition Technology**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/) to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the Delhi Police to cease such use [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)).  


Subsequently, there were [**reports**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/from-facial-recognition-system-to-four-layer-security-delhi-police-gears-up-for-r-day-11579892354659.html) that the Delhi Police used drones on crowds during the Republic Day parade in January, 2020 to “maintain vigil”. In February, 2020 there were [**reports**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-riots-police-special-commissioner) that the Delhi Police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in North-East Delhi.   


Now [**reports**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5146-held-in-delhi-for-defying-lockdown-1018-vehicles-seized/articleshow/74801660.cms) are emerging that the Delhi Police is using [**drones**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/covid-19-drones-used-to-enforce-lockdown-more-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders/articleshow/74831906.cms) to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the Government in a bid to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   


**The Delhi Police confirms using drones**

On February 14, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking the following questions:

1. Whether the Delhi Police has procured drones for any purpose?

2. Details of the tender issued for such procurement.

3. Information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.

4. Information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.

5. Whether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?

6. Any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.  


Our request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones.    


**Here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**

1. The North-East District has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.

2. Since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.

3. The Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).

4. The technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.

5. The PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.

6. In response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was “no comment”.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter anyway?**

There are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.

1. Hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.

2. Since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed.    


**So what now?**

IFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). The only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.

It is being said that after 31st March, these Stressed Assets will need to be classified as NPAs. All of a sudden the NPA on books will increase by Rs 9 LAKH CRORES. (Eg 80,000 cr NPA of Mudra Scheme introduced in 2015)

UN recently came out with a report that stated 'India's debt has surpassed to over 40% of its GDP'

It's just that until 31st March, most of these were not official recognised as NPA and hence people are not alarmed. Will the economy completely tank after 31st March or will we able to handle this shockwave?

g4s5yd,"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.","Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again.

fz16t8,Overpopulation - how I would go about trying to fix it,"By 2050, we are projected to add a further ~300mn more to our current 1.3bn to reach a total of 1.7bn. Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the Coivd-19 crisis. This problem is not limited to India alone, as all of South Asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

Political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - India has a dark past with population ""control"". The Indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy). In any event, I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

In my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. Participation will be totally voluntary. The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. Government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists (**BITCH**). At maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. Alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. In lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. Medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. I personally don't care for this, but most people do. In any event, Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. I think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. School/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. It's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. The best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

I want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. However, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. For instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. Naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. Having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its Aadhar database. Further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

folpw5,The classic case of the cure being worse than the disease.,"&#x200B;

I actually think there will be an uptick of cases in the next few weeks what with all the clapping nonsense and dancing in the streets and now this rampaging through the commercial areas and crowding, and totally erratic behavior all round and the shite show with the police beating up everybody on plain sight without empathizing with people who Might actually have a valid reason to be outside.

I mean I get the bit about lockdowns, but half the time, its just a shite-show with all the ppl running to the stores, crowding up and being very erratic overall and I am not criticizing that, as that is perfectly understandable, we never know what these ppl are going through, it could be an essential for their ailing grandparents or their cancer stricken child, but does anybody think the lockdowns are almost always haphazard in their execution, and it seems to be defeating the purpose of it all.

Some of the success stories like Taiwan, hk, and even South Korea, its more about social distancing, and wearing masks at all times and practicing good hygiene especially around the elderly, and finally controlling the inbound and outbound flights and treating the airports as ground zero and being very vigilant with the quarantine, hongkong implemented trackers for all incoming passengers with threat of serious consequences i.e fines and even solitary confinement,  and it seems to have worked a treat. Lockdowns were not really implemented as they thought it would be counter productive and stores and super markets and public transportation facilities  were kept open 24x7 with a condition that only 30% of the capacity allowed at any given time, which was actually sensible rather than shutting down everything or having limited operating hours which just creates a mad rush and totally counter productive. 

yeah, I honestly think a lot of countries have never faced a situation like this. uncharted territory really, but looking at the success stories like south korea and hk, and even Taiwan, and replicating the exact same strategies would have gone a long way, instead of haphazardly implementing draconian counter-productive strategies that have not been thought through.

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

**Like donating burnol after  scalding a person accidentally** . Its hardly called as a generous gesture . They diverted  the first segment of antibody test kits which threw spanner  in  our testing program. . 

 \>Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high ?

China didnt reach its current place by assuming moral high ground . They dont care about it now. 

Taking moral highground against china will not help because they do not contest for it.

China is a very practical  country , it can never be a friend or an ally.  Once the string of pearls are defeated through either force or debt diplomacy , they will set eyes on us.

g43omc,What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)

Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  

*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 

In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi’s Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: “Why is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capital’s catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?”

In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores “on a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhi’s pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the people’s good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.”

The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishore’s article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firm’s previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their execution  “upon the removal of  “obstacles” like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practices”. The firm’s past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting “an innate disrespect for the  citizen”.

In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:

“The biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs Elysées? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: ‘It brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayer’s expense.”

Kishore’s essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.

In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

The prime minister’s own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone – the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn’t quite do  for Narendra Modi.

To my mind, the Modi government’s redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  ruler’s immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean Bédel-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaul’s essay ‘[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)’).

Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  

As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why can’t the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme – estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting – be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?

Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money – not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year – probably longer – before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.

In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice – sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

f1pc0h,Online video streaming and TV are not the same. So why is the IAMAI trying to make it so?,"&#x200B;

## TL; DR:

On 5th February, 2020 the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it provides the basis for the creation of the Digital Content Complaint Council (along the lines of a similar system in place for TV) to oversee content creation and distribution in the online video streaming space. Although there are only four signatories (as opposed to nine in the case of a previous iteration), there are rumbling that the group is seeking government endorsement of this initiative. We have written to the IAMAI and copied the letter to both the Union Ministries of Information & Broadcasting; and Electronics and Information Technology highlighting how this will lead to self-censorship to the detriment of internet users, creators, producers and competition within the market. Based on these grounds we have asked the industry body to roll back the code and asked government authorities to refrain from endorsing the framework.

## Background

This post is to update everyone that there is a risk brewing in India’s online video streaming space. And said risk could see us sleep walk into a scenario where online content in India, mimics its formulaic television counterpart. On 5th February 2020, at its annual India Digital Summit, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) launched its *Code for Self-Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers*. It follows up an earlier *Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers* the industry body had  put out in January 2019.

Unlike the previous code which had nine signatories, the latest iteration has just four signatories namely, Hotstar, Voot, Jio and SonyLiv. Prior signatories including Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji, Arre and ErosNow were conspicuously absent at the new code’s launch. Other major players like Amazon (Prime) and Google (YouTube Premium) have stayed away from the process since its inception. Considering India has more than 35 online video streaming providers, the Code is not really representative of the entire industry’s position. So then why are we concerned if it is only being carried out by such a small number of players?

## Our Take: This is a precursor to self-censorship and for online streaming to go down the path of TV

Simply put it is the first step towards broad basing self-censorship as industry practice in India’s online video streaming space. If that is indeed the outcome, it would adversely impact internet users in India, creators, artists, production companies and so on. It is also likely to harm competition, innovation, investment and would facilitate industry capture by a few firms over the ecosystem.

The framework essentially builds on the original code of best practices through some key changes. First and most importantly, it seeks to establish an independent enforcement authority called the Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) to oversee a signatory’s content related practices. This DCCC mechanism is eerily similar and largely derivative of the [**Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC)**](https://www.ibfindia.com/sites/default/files/Guidelines--Term%20of%20broadcas%20changes.pdf) (under the Indian Broadcasting Foundation) which essentially governs content on non-news and television channels in India.

We all know what that has meant to Indian television and how that has led to a largely homogenous content ecosystem, inundated by typical saas-bahu programming devoid of much creativity or pathos. Moreover, how often do we watch our favourite international content on TV and get bummed out that a large chunk of the programming has been edited out? In this context, the online video streaming space was a breadth of fresh air for Indian audiences who were fans of global and local storytelling. Further, it provided opportunities to local storytellers who had until then been rejected by traditional television, theatrical and radio media.

## The legal basis and policy need for this effort is questionable at best

In this context, it is disconcerting that even though there is no legal mechanism which empowers the DCCC, its ties with the Government are undeniable. The proposed DCCC is meant to be chaired by a retired High Court or Supreme Court judge. Also, the DCCC is designed to include three members from national level statutory commissions like the National Commission for Women (NCW), the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)  or the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Its composition would also facilitate incumbent business capture as the DCCC is meant to include three industry representatives and two online curated content providers (likely to be signatories to the Code). Considering the opaque manner (with no public/stakeholder inputs) in which the Code has been developed, and the public facing impact such a privately designed framework can have-- the legal validity of this effort remains dubious at best.

Second, such codified structures essentially provide the Government a parallel avenue with little to no legal accountability to apply pressure on businesses to censor people’s views and beliefs. It erodes channels for dissent and satire-- and is arguably incompatible with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India.

Third, like the previous code on best practices, the new code for self-regulation talks about “prohibited content”. What is particularly dangerous is that the newest draft has been modified in a manner which makes the grounds for censorship vaguer. This would afford the DCCC with more discretion to remove certain speech/content which would otherwise be legal under the Constitution of India and also applicable laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  This is compounded by the fact that the DCCC does not envision membership of stakeholders from research, academia or free speech backgrounds, to act as a safeguard for people’s right to receive and impart information. Therefore, it may be concluded that this Code is merely a liability reduction initiative which is being pushed through at the cost of plurality, diversity and creativity-- all cornerstone’s of the right to free speech and expression.

## Our letter to IAMAI

In a [**letter dated 17th January, 2019**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LKE-1DkhtFY3ZWWXpRdnRuVEpwWmMzYW1kR21yejA3d2g0/view) we had previously written to the IAMAI voicing our objection to the initial Code for Best Practices. We argued it was a slippery slope which would act as a precursor towards self-censorship in the Indian online content space. Our beliefs are reinforced by the latest Code for Self-Regulation and we have [**sent a representation to the IAMAI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3eJQghsUwOJEYU1ri0ah2roO0BVSju0/view?usp=sharing) requesting them to roll back the effort. In addition, we have shared a copy with both the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), to brief them with the issues of endorsing the framework.

fpzu2u,Narendra Modi Likely To Declare A Emergency In India Under Article 360,"*It's a whatsapp forward. Wanted your opinion on this matter.*

Let us first understand, what is Article 360.

Article 360 in the constitution of India is for imposing a nationwide financial emergency in India.

Financial Emergency (Article 360):
Article 360 states that if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or the credit of India or any part thereof is threatened, the President may declare a state of financial emergency.
During the period such Proclamation is in operation, the executive authority of the Union extends to the giving of directions to any State to observe such canons of financial propriety as may be specified in the directions, any such directions may also include:
A provision required the reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of person serving a State or the Union.
A provision requiring all Money Bills or other Financial Bills to be reserved for the consideration of the President after they are passed by the legislature of the State.
A Proclamation issued under Article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament.
A proclamation issued under Article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament.
Once approved it remains in force till revoked by the President.
No emergency under Article 360 has been issued so far.

India had been going through one of the worst phases of the financial crisis in its 72 years of history, India’s top 3 rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s and S&P have already reduced India’s growth GDP to the lowest marks much before corona.

Now, this corona epidemic would have a long lasting & frightening effect on the Indian economy which might push India almost 70 years back similar to the partion era. Let’s connect the dots altogether.

1. The reserve bank of India has already made a war room with 90 people keeping an eye on the Indian economy which has never been done earlier in the entire history of the reserve bank.

2. Foreign investors pulled out 1.08 lakh crore rupees from Indian market in just 15 trading sessions

3. Almost 80% of the Indian companies are asking their employees to work from home, many companies including go air & air india have asked their staff to go on unpaid leaves, most companies have also terminated several employees.

4. Almost 80% of the major financial centers of the country are in lockdown including Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Chennai, Kolkatta, Gurgaon, Noida, Ahemdabad, Surat.

5. US Dollor has the all time highest value against Indian currency, at the time of writing this article 1:53 AM midnight 23 march 2020, 1 USD was equal to 75.62.

6. Corona cases in India at the time of writing this article has reached 415.

7. Several sectors including hotels, restaurants, night clubs, bars, airlines, BPO, tourism, entertainment & Bollywood, auto-mobile, aviation, hospitality, apparel, consumer durables and electronics, Poultry and Seafood, construction, transport, railway are worst hit by this epidemic.

8. Several associated sectors also had a huge impact on their revenues like oil-petrol, security service industry and many others whose revenues are directly & indirectly dependent on the above sectors.

9. Coronavirus infection is spreading like fire and Indian agencies would not be able to control it in the near future, if by any chance, it enters into the fourth stage, which it is most likely to enter due to citizens ignorance, it would be the worst crisis in the entire history of Independent India.

10. Right now coronavirus is only among rich & elite who are able to handle the financial burdens & have multiple resources in terms of healthcare, work, financial savings and can still to self isolate & prevent it from spreading but Once it enters into people under Below Poverty Line, it would almost be impossible to control it and a large chunk of India’s revenue would be invested to handle the situation.

11. The reserve bank stored funds including the contingency funds & emergency funds have already depleted after RBI gave multiple chunks of large money to the current government.

12. Several Private & government banks in India have the highest NPA and loan defaulters doesn’t seem to be in any mood to be paying it off soon.

13. The share markets of India, including the National Stock Exchange (NSE) & Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are continuously falling.

Connecting all the points from 1 to 13

One can easily understand that fighting coronavirus & controlling the economy of the country almost seems impossible for the current government.

We still hope for the best and wish all the luck to the government and its agencies to curb the situation.

frks4g,An honest thought on how India could economically prosper,"This thought has been bothering me for sometime so maybe if I share it here, it might provide me some relief.  
Before I go further, I’d like to re-iterate again that this is just a thought & there maybe several ways to improve upon it.  
  
Firstly every citizen should be liable to pay direct tax. If it’s a farmer, poor person, any working adult should pay a measly suggested sum of say ₹10 **per fiscal year** as their share of tax.  

How would this help?  
  
First things first, we are too large a nation not to collect any direct tax from the vast majority of the people. I understand rich people pay more tax but only so much tax can be collected from them. I think the government may have stretched their limits here because increasing any rate on them would eventually funnel more money through their backdoors (black money, foreign tax havens).  
Also, it’s no hidden fact that the majority of black money is generated from agricultural activities which are not liable to report any income since they are fully exempt. Politicians & Rich businessman funnel a lot of money through this buy showing part of their income from agricultural land.  
It would also help the government to identify beneficiaries of their schemes because there will be somewhat accurate picture of the people who paid tax and are the benefactors of their scheme.",False,8TC,Policy/Economy,12,2020-03-30 18:42:17,10,0,The collection would be a problem not the amount of money..the cost would be more than the amount collected unless we could do direct debit in the accounts of the poor who get disbursements through aadhar as tax collection.. ,,True,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frks4g/an_honest_thought_on_how_india_could_economically/

In this threat I want to draw attention to differences in Indian and Korean approach to COVID containment. I am doing this because I have seen lot of whatsapp forwards and talked to few friends and relative who think that Indian approach is more or less same as South Korea.

Before I get started, I want to clarify I am not criticizing any of two approach. This is comparison with respect to what is currently considered best practice. I understand circumstances limit how well it can be copied in India.

**Testing**

India: Must be international traveler or have come in contact with infected person. Recently, pneumonia cases are also allowed to be tested.

Korea: Anyone can get tested. If you have any symptoms, you call a number, they direct you to nearest center. A doctor check you and if symptoms match, you get test for free. Additionally, if   you come in contact of any infected person, you get test for free. If you are just worried and want to get tested, you pay ~120$.

**Treatment Cost**

India: I have no information on this.

Korea: ~40$ if you have national insurance. ~1400$ if you don't. All citizens have it. ~50% foreigners have it.*

**Shut Down**

Korea: There is no broad shut down. Large gatherings (events, protest, etc.), religious congregations and karaoke are banned.#

India: Ya all know.

**Delivery**

India: Shit show.
Korea: No limitation what so ever. Encouraged.

Personal comment: Why the f govt. cares if someone want to order non essential stuff from amazon?

**Tracking & Isolation**

India: Wholesale isolation of anyone and everyone. Release excel files and put stickers, broadcasting the isolation of person/household.

Korea: If you are coming from COVID infected area, you must isolated for 14 days.^ If someone is found to be infected, his movement are traced and made public. If you live in same district or have visited it, you get message informing you off same. You can check the same online for each individual patient. 

**Business**

India: Shut down everything with limited exception.

Korea: No restriction. If someone is found to be infected, it is shut down for disinfection and things are back on soon.

**WFH**

India: Idk how common is this

Korea: Encouraged but not very common. Schools are closed, university is online.

fwh7oa,Extensive testing is an insurance to avoid lockdown,"Singapore just had a spike of 120 cases yesterday because of a couple of dormitories. It seems like a small spark can cause a fire.

One of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine. Several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad. I am going to make an insurance-like case for that taking India as a case.

Some back of the envelope calculation:

Cost of a test: upto 60$ (in India)
Doing 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

This sounds like a lot... until we look at the cost of lockdown which is ~ $120 billion for 3 weeks. So, basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test 500,000 people everyday for 200 days. And there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then.

There can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the 500k tests per day and that's a later discussion. I am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt country-wide lockdown. Basically, pay a small cost to avoid another lockdown in the future.

PS1: Note that the cost of test will likely go down significantly (say an order of magnitude) if we scale up.

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

### Relevance for India and What’s Next?

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

I'm looking at creating a distributed manufacturing, power generation, and transportation network in the U.S. The idea is to have people making parts of something. Those parts are transported via drone to another local finishing / assembly plant which is then delivered via drone to the final customer. 

You wouldn't have to build everything at once for this to work. You could for example create a network of local people who have access to or can make 3d printers. Then each of the people who have a printer can then accept jobs from the matter hackers network, and then print them within a certain time frame. The parts could be delivered via traditional mail even. 

I'm really sorry for what's happening to you. I really hope you find something, and probably most of what you find will be easier and more realistic then what I'm proposing. However if we do get a global matter hackers network going it could provide financial stability for so many.

Right now the group I started on Facebook is purely focused on using 3d printers, laser cutters, or just by handiwork i.e. cloth masks to produce PPE for healthcare providers, and our communities in general. You can see what we are doing if you look up COVID Homebrew Mask Relief on Facebook groups. We're actually working on a trully global scale in that group since we have people from all over the world. Ideally each unit would be powered by sustainable/ renewable energy. Each unit would also have food production capacity as well. So if for example someone needs some spinach for example. They could see if it was available on the matter hackers network nearby. 

I personally think humanity deserves a UBI however until that's politically possible I want to utilize networks so that we can all create a web of support for each other. The network could use a certain percent of income to purchase the needed equipment to expand the network so for example eventually you wouldn't need to buy a 3d printer or other equipment it would be provided for you. You would also have to make people use proper ventilation and sequestration techniques while they are printing. The last thing I would want to see is people getting cancer for example due to the fumes.

g1lmhg,[Please Advice] Reality punched me in the face today.,"Sorry Reddit, this post is going to be long. Please bear with me. Also using a throwaway account for privacy concerns.


This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

She says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

A little background about my family:
We're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
At this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. 

Cut to the question:
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.

I really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. My dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.I have a job now, and I'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from September.

I don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can I do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",False,throaway-forprivacy,AskIndia,429,2020-04-15 18:49:08,83,0,"Don't take on formal debt to clear informal debt.

Prioritise getting your landlord paid, at least the monthly rent. Then add on to it to clear old dues. If you have credit card debt, prioritise that too.

Then start paying off relatives. First the small debts and then the large debts.

Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are.

We(M22|F25) are in relationship from past three year.
We both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



We also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



Things are going not as I supposed to go .


Now she have changed her mind completely.


A brief background about her - She have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


Even now she and her mother supports the family.


No one respects her family as they are poor.


She feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.



Now she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


She wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
She wants to rest and enjoy her life.


She said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


She can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.


She also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.


She will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)


If she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

I asked her that I will try my best to give her best life but I need one year of support from her so that I can buy a house on EMI but she ends up breaking up.

g0ybrw,Got struck by a cop today,"I was out to get some meds for my mentally and physically handicapped niece. To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

I can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. What do you guys think?

Edit: Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through. I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place. 

Neither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first.

This is what they are doing:

- After buying raw vegetables, they keep it outside their home for 72 hours

- After 72 hours, they wash each and every piece of vegetable, even lemons and chilies with soap water, then cold water, then hot water

- After that, they keep it in the fridge or cook them

My friend is worried, as her husband wont listen to the arguments that soap can be harmful for the vegetables. They have a little kid as well.

- Is washing vegetables with soap ok?

fx71yh,"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?","Note: I am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

fvgj13,How do I get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?,"I hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet in-law drama, read on.

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

fwo8b6,[P] How to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?,"My dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism. He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

fwm5c3,Do you think India should revoke lockdown on April 14 ?,"Personally, I believe that our corona virus cases would increase exponentially after April 14 if lockdown is revoked.

* India’s current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. Which I think is nowhere near enough. 

* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

Even if we’re on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it’s Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they’d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it’d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

Also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we’ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve.

fzr4n4,Why are we Indians bad at taking risks?,"When we compare ourselves to people in the west, I think we can say that we are just as talented as them if not more and we have a bigger population which means the number of intelligent Indians is more even if the percentage of intelligent Indians is not higher. 

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? I am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

Please note that I am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. I was just wondering why as a country we all do this. I also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

fjj42g,Women in India with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life.,"Life becomes unbearable without the love and affection of the family members and the belongingness of society. Unfortunately for KumariNayak, a 63-year-old woman from the Ganjan district of Odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has Polydactylism.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/se8pqngcm0n41.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a05d1d9821b72ee428b88ec5d46e8bd0b2a717b

Polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. In the case of Kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names. 

Kumari said in an interview: ‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘

As she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

It has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, ‘The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’

One of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

On hearing Kumari’s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

In 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases. 

Let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day.

g681o8,[M-21/engineering student] How to marry my girlfriend of other religion?,"I'm 21 year old, she is 23 year old and Muslim. My family has no objection with her and they're just worried about my safety.

Our families are quite opposite

her younger sister is 20 year old and married, my elder brother is 30 year old and bachelor. (he has no plan of marrying till 35)

Currently I do freelancing for social media marketing and earn $500-2k per month {approx $1k}

we're in relationship for 5 years, we both are kinda shy and sweet. so, we both never had fight with ourselves (or even anyone else as a individual!)

I'm athiest (born hindu) but she is religious and do 5x namaz/day, goes to madarsa but still she is pretty chill and open-minded. I'm into dank memes. she never gets offended in any dark memes of her religion.  (she is unicorn)

Her home is in colony (where her 200-300 relatives lives too). so, there is risk of getting lynched by mob while dropping her or picking her. (because I'm hindu)

&#x200B;

Actually I had no intention of marrying till age 30 but I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her. and since she wants to marry. so, offcourse I will. I'm willing to do anything for her.

So, the issue is that my family want me to wait few years but in her family there relatives are recommending her mom to marry her with her cousin. (also, they don't know about our relationship and will definitely be against me)

g35581,Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?

g7dn32,Is this racist?,"Hello guys, I'm an ispiring author from Brazil. Love your country and culture.

So, to the matter I would like your opinion. 

Recently I finished my latest project. It's an urban fantasy/thriller where a group of young people discover they have powers of gods and creatures from various ancient mythologies. The major problem I found while writing this, was naming the characters, so for most of them, I named them with something that could reference the god they had the powers of.

For exemple, there's Fiona, who has the powers of a shapeshifting witch. Fiona being a common name for a white witch in Ireland. Also Diana, who has the powers of the goddess Artemis, goddess of the moon. For the one with the powers of Zeus, I named Edison after Thomas Edison who had a great deal of influence in revolutionazing electricity.

But the one I struggled the most to name was the antagonist, who has the powers of Apollo. Until someday I mentioned it to a friend of mine and she told me to name him Ravi, a common Indian name that means ""The Sun"". I loved the idea, and I made him have Indian ancestry. His ethnicity wasn't a big part of his character, just some background for him. Nothing wrong with that, right? Or so I thought. It wasn't until I finished it that I became aware of the problem.

A major part of Ravi's early plot, is his job. It's how he meets some important people, it's how he comes to despise the main character. I had written this part before naming him and giving him the Indian ancestry. He works at a telemarketing company. See the big stereotype now? This was never intended.

So now I come to think of it, is this racist/xenophobic? Should I change his name and ancestry or maybe even try to rewritte the plot with him working a different job?

fqdz4b,My cousin is a sexual abuser. Do I confront him?,"Should I forgive my sexual abuser? TW: Sexual abuse/assault

Hi reddit.

For context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. 

I've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn't stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. I'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I've been around him A LOT these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don't know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don't know how to bring this up. I don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I'm prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? I know it's a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that I have forgiven him? Also, how would you go about this situation? Any and all advice is appreciated!

fleoe8,Although rape is a serious problem in our country that needs to stop. There is another problem of false rape accusations that nobody seems to wanna talk about.,"Before I start, I'd like to make it clear that I do believe Rape is a heinous crime and there should be severe punishments for those who commit it. Having said that, shouldn't someone who is innocent also getting the same punishment and being discarded by society be talked about too? what about the woman who made up the story, shouldn't she be punished for ruining someone's life? 

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. In 10,068 cases – about a quarter – the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage. In Andhra Pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category. Just think about that, every 1 in 3 is an innocent man, and in Andra Pradesh, that's 1 in 2 where for every 2 rape accusations an innocent man's life is ruined.

It's sad because Rape is a very sensitive subject which people avoid talking about and these problems are still happening every day. I'm tired of hearing every other country saying that our country is the rape capital of the world and no one if only a few dares to talk about false accusations. 

I referenced an article in this post for stats and here is the link:  [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims)

fusgpt,"I am Depressed , Helpless , dont know what to do please Guide me and give me some Advice's , Please Help Me !"," hi my name is Samarth and I will be 20yrs old this may. A little bit about me ever since I was 9yrs old I have been a fan of animation ( anime in particular ) and through various trials in my life from not been able to draw a simple circle to convince my parents to let me choose animation as my career path I have come a long way (I mean for me atleast) 

I don't know how to explain this feeling but for the past couple of days (7-10maybe) I have been very down , depressed , my heart aches daily like there's a hand grabbing my heart pressing it what not and I have even cried a lot before going to sleep ( silently although I wanted to shout at the top of my head but couldn't as it would wake my parents ) 

What I am trying to say maybe is that I am currently feeling as if I don't know anything about animation be it 2d or 3d ..everyday I keep on practicing and learning and try to do my best but it never feels enough and I am worried sick what will I do after I graduate ( I am in my 2nd year if college ) 

The thing is I am self taught because I failed my NID and DUFA exam mainly because I have been practicing art digitally since I was in 9-10th standard or so and the exams where in traditional medium my dad asked if I wanted to go for a private uni for arts but I declined the offer because I was told by a couple of people and professional that it's pretty much useless and I chose one of the easiest course in DU in the hopes that I will have a lot of free time to teach myself and spare money to buy equipment if necessary (my fee is only 27000 for 3years)  both of these things came true I do have a a lot of time and my fee is not much .

I knew this was a risky move getting into a course that's not related to animation ( it is, if u thing of it as a business because I do want to have my own studio and it does kinda help ) and I believed a lot in myself that I will do good but apparently I haven't ! As much as I want to tell my parents that I am scared as to what I would do in the future, I just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..I don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .

I should also mention this I do plan to do a 6 month diploma on animation and fine arts after I graduate respectively 

The reason I made this post is because I wanted to let go of this feeling JUST LET ME OUT. And get a good couple of advice from people who are in the Animation industry as to how it works and stuff and get in touch with them , get some advice from people to resolve this feeling and most importantly to find myself a mentor who couple give me tasks to do this and that either weekly or monthly and later review my works and broadly point my mistakes and give me some direction 

All the hard-work would come from me but I need someone to guide me ! YouTube videos would never point out my mistake and I need someone to I guess

I will link my best works at the end.

I have figured I work best when someone gives me deadline to work with. I just need someone to tell me who actually has knowledge to from either school or industry to give me assignment and nothing more I will find what that things means etc etc and just review my work at the end .

I beg you if you thing you have that kind of knowledge and can spare 30-40min a week or a month please help this stranger ( I told my name in the beginning because I believe one stops thing of you as a complete stranger if they know your name ) 

You don't even have to give me your phone number or email address we can talk directly on Reddit message or Instagram or Facebook or any other app that you might thing is comfortable ( in case this message looks like a scam) 

But I beg you if you can spare a couple of minutes a week or a month to help me please do although I don't have anything to give in return but I would be ever grateful for your help.

Copied this comment to highlight my point. 

""Only from the economic effects. There are less old people and way less people with severe health conditions (who in our rich western nations are only alive because of the health service anyway). 65% of India's population is under 35 - they are at no risk at all from CV19. The median age is 26.8 compared to the USA 38.2. Tuberculosis kills 220,000 people every year in India and that is a disease that already has a vaccine. So far the country is in lockdown for a massive total of 680 CV19 deaths.

It is absolutely crazy that these countries are attempting a 'lockdown' strategy, when 3,000 children die from starvation every day in India. It's completely pointless, the extra mortality from CV19 will only be a blip for India, the mortality from the extra starvation deaths alone, let alone the ensuing economic consequences, will be way, way worse."" - Ilovewillsface



I think they got enough time. This virus is not as dangerous as they say it is and it also hasn't caused much damage. More people die from accidents, other health issues. I think India is strong and immune to face this virus without lockdown. Why can't we just move on and live with it?

The virus is spread from the water droplets that come out of an infected person when they speak or cough or sneeze. So maintaining enough distance (at least 2m) from people (anyone) is important. Virus stays in air for sometime depending upon the humidity, so wearing mask is important. Virus can show its first symptoms after 5-12 days so don’t neglect social distancing ( this term hardly anyone knows in better way but it is just keeping distance from people of at least about 2m or more) at any cost. Virus can stay on different surface so maintaining personal and surrounding hygiene is important. But no govt official or media is taking an effort to educate people about all this information. Rather forcing everyone to stay at home. I understand that this will ultimately keep people away from other but what if the lockdown ends?

g5cv1j,[Help] Potential SIM swapping/hacking,"Hi /r/india,

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!

I have been a member of this community for so long and I love this community for its progressive thoughts. I wanted to get something off my chest and also ask you folks' opinion.

I have held this off inside me for too long but today want to put it out. My father is a narcissist and manipulative person. He hasn't worked in his entire life and has only done few menial jobs for very less time. My mother has struggled hard to raise me by securing a government job with her father's and brother's efforts.

However, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of Indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla.

Today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and I couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. The shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. After this, I realized that this is not good so I sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. But he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. It's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

I've had a great childhood, my parents have been very liberal about most things except the fact that I get married outside the community. That's all they've ever asked. As luck would have it, recently told my mother about my north-Indian boyfriend and she is shocked. Told me they will never accept this, especially my father, who she said might commit suicide. She hasn't even asked me questions about my boyfriend,  just says ""we don't accept this, you can do what you want"". She is not one for emotional reactions or drama (which I would honestly prefer at this point), just says ""No, not happening."" That's it, and she is supposed to be the more reasonable one. I managed to wheedle some information  that might matter to them in while talking, including how much he makes (""Don't run after money, not important!!"") and that his family is on-board (""then do what you want, we don't accept it, it will never happen!!""

Telling my father is going to be a whole other event. He cares even more deeply about the caste, can be counted on to always have an emotional reaction than a reasonable one. Logic almost always eludes him. I'm actually worried about his blood pressure when I break this to him. The hypocrisy is strong because I found out about his affair, but that has conveniently been forgotten. I don't want to use that as ammo but might have to if it gets out of hand.Also, my relatives are pieces of shit. My brother lives in the US and had a inter-caste marriage himself, but they use that for ""he has done this to us already, you can't do this as well. We'll become the laughing stock of the family"" My brother has done his bit by trying to talk to Mom and is supportive, but that's doesn't seem to be helping.

I'm successful, make decent money, am financially independent and am living in a separate apartment even with my parents in the same city because it's closer to work. My boyfriend is extremely smart and successful, makes more money than my parents can fathom and is genuinely, obviously the nicest guy. I'm convinced if they meet him, they will find no reason to fight this, but I'm sure they will refuse to meet him for a very long time.

My parents and I don't usually fight, unless we're discussing politics.

g1yhv3,Suggest trendy & catchy name for my fintech startup - financial inclusion for everyone!,"Hi, 



We are building Future of credit - Financial inclusion to everyone

We are searching for kickass name & which should not related to credit, it should be trendy, easy to  spell for every one country agnostic, we are creating a new platform where it takes milli seconds to  apply loan by  borrower with or without financial history Lenders able to underwrite & disburse the loan in seconds, with out human intervention. We are also changing the entire credit process  & using smart phone alternative credit data. We are using AI, ML, quantum computing in big time you’re interested in changing the future of credit.

3 billion humans cannot access basic credit services and fewer than 9% of citizens in developing economies have ever taken a loan from a financial institution.

In many economies, generations of people are governed by a dark underworld of illegal lending  a pseudo-economy ran by gangsters and fraudsters. For these 3 billion people, the idea of accessing enough credit to buy a home or start a business is a pipe dream. 

In countries rich and poor, access to credit is a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility. No matter your age, gender, language or nation, credit is the key driving force to boosting prosperity. From a newlywed couple looking to settle down and buy their first home, to an aspiring entrepreneur looking to start a small business, virtually every human on the planet depends on credit. It is the gateway to financial inclusion and ultimately financial freedom.

chze6i,Timing of Dhoni's stint with the army and Amrapali group Sham leak,"Just going through the news and following cricket, I would like to put forth a timeline of events to bring about an unbiased conclusion, so here goes the timeline

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above).

fz62ox,"(Story time) 13th Dec, 1971 - The day when Russian Nuclear warheads surfaced on the Bay of Bengal to stop USS Enterprise from attacking India","During the 1971 war between India and Pakistan for the liberation of Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan), US and UK sided with Pakistan and sent their warships to India and US. 

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

g59jnx,"Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history? In general, there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India.","So, I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar.  He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

g3mehq,India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

The Hindu-muslim binary is useful in ending any caste class consciousness that may arise among bahujan pasmandas. 

So my question is - how relevant is caste among Indian Muslims? Is endogamy practiced in any form? (I've heard syeds used to only marry amongst themselves but now they marry other upper caste muslims as well - similar to how brahmins now marry baniyas as well)
Is there an overlap between these caste groups and wealth/income levels? ",,True,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw2u16/i_am_an_exmuslim_ama/

g2ct57,A polite request to all Indians here,"I don't know if it is the same situation in other countries, but in India, I have seen A LOT of organisations which have very toxic environments.

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments.

I am from Mumbai. She was from Delhi/UP (not sure from the tone). I spoke in the language that we use on the streets including expletives and threats. 

My exemption was approved without any hassles in less than 48 hours after i yelled at her. No adverse impact later.

India doesn't have a good work culture. The so called work culture (at least in structure and productivity mapping) we see in software companies is because of the forced discipline from international companies. On our own, we basically do whatever we want and call it procedure. We are supposed to love our company because ""in India, employers usually dont fire us"". Except for Tata Steel (not TCS), i know of no such company.

Even in MNCs, i remember a tamil manager, who had an unstated heirarchy of hiring - First Tamilians, if no tamilian available, then anyone from south india. If anyone not from South India made it (because he didnt have entire control) he wasn't rude or bad. He just made sure all the plum positions, opportunities, meetings, rewards went to his tamil buddies. How I know this?

Do as much Zakaat(**Charity**) as you can, knowing how the condition of people are these days, please do more Zakaat than the mandatory 2.5% of your, annual income + your total wealth including assets such as investments in shares and mutual funds, gold jewellery etc. 

Also praying Taraweeh( ***Special prayers involving the reading of long portions of the Quran, as well as performing many rakahs (cycles of movement involved in Islamic prayer***)) is a Sunnah (***Sunnah*** ***is an action that was performed by our beloved prophet Muhammad S.A.W***), so dont abandon it and keep praying by staying in your house. Just a suggestion, you dont have to finish the whole Quran in Taraweeh, read the first 20 Surahs( **A Surah is the term for a chapter of the Quran** ) during the 20 Rakaats(  **one unit of Islamic prayer, or Salah** ) of Taraweeh and repeat the same everyday.

May this holy month bring peace, compassion and satisfaction in your life and keep everyone away from any harm.

g0dofi,101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread],"***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

g4n0hx,"Is it only the common people who have to abide by the rules, boundaries and whatever......","First of all, I have utmost respect for the people who put forth the safety of others before their own, and are sincerely standing their grounds to do whatever little or more they can do to be of help for anybody not only in the current situation but anytime.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.

Hey Everyone,

I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb

No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great

**Premium Segment**

[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

ffyots,My Covid-19 quarantine experience,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative

g0hyb8,Buying a car in India seems a stupid decision to me.,"I'm only saying it seems like a stupid decision to me and not actually calling others stupid so please don't feel offended.

Most people that I have seen buying car are the ones spending their entire year salary's equivalent sum of money buying something they don't really need. Some people even spend amount equivalent to their two year's salary on a depreciation asset like car.

I ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. I also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

It's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what I feel.

I completely understand some people buy car for reasons like status in society, comfort etc. By no means am against them, just sharing what I think.

It's not just about protection from the sun, rain, dust and other stuff that's outside.   
I don't know how to explain it in a way you can relate, but think of it as something like cooking. For many, cooking is just a means to prepare food to eat, but for some, it's so much more than that.

g42eq3,Vodafone India TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I'm a Redx customer (Rs 999/mo), and Vodafone promises ""Unlimited internet"", with ""No max limit"" for this plan. I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.

I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.

Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!

I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!

I also tried and opened a case with resolver, wrote to their social media channels including Twitter, nowhere could I get any help.

flvwr6,Long rant about how religion fucks me up,"I’m ashamed of my whole family. Idiots think that my poor cat causes corona and gave 2 of my 5 cats away. Bastards. My grandma straight up kicked my cat and called it bastard. I told her indirectly to never come to my house. These stupid ‘ustads’ (muslim priests) make some videos on YouTube saying shit like this , which my granny listens to and tells the rest of my family who like fools agree with what she says. “Chickens,goats and cats” cause corona it seems. I asked her, people have been having these animals for millennia. And my cat is an indoor cat for god sake. I’m not very religious but my family has turned into some cult right now. Full time these Islamic speeches will be played in YouTube at full volume which irritates the shit out of me. They are in Arabic too, my family doesn’t even know Arabic , they think listening to it will bless us and protect us or some shit. My mom posts all this religious stuff and saying allah is the best and some of those sentences sometimes make it seem like she’s in a cult and totally brainwashed. It also affects my dads business, you know how? Dad and mom works together as an event company and most of my dads clients are Hindus , who after seeing all this try to stay away. It may sound crazy but there are many clients who have often told other clients not to make events from us since we are biased to Islam. My dad tells my mom not to be so religious atleast in social media where thousands of people will be viewing. It’s kind of like her business number. My moms name sounds very much like a Muslim name so they decided to change it(not officially) to seem neutral to all religions. You ask why go to such extents, it’s just a religion? My dad almost lost an event from a multi millionaire because his friends circle were Hindus and told not to organise event from us. Instead go to other alternative , he stayed with us but guess what happened next? He didn’t pay the amount of the quotation(bill) and flew to Singapore. So that my dad doesn’t call him. And on top of all this shit, now this coronavirus shit happened and they bring religion to all this and I feel like I’m in a cult. I don’t like it, if I’m at home I’m on my PC from morning to night so it’s not a huge problem for me. But since there are holidays for everyone , my mom always takes us to our granny’s house where everyone stays (joint family) , all these people who have jobs are currently staying at home and including the ones who were always jobless are together. It’s a huge cult now, all day I’m asked to pray, every 5 minutes(almost literally) I’m reminded that cats give coronavirus and insults to my cats keep coming. Although there’s clearly NO evidence to it at all. They also say that the world will be wiped out by this virus since it’s written in the Quran or something which I don’t think is true.

fvwclb,Quora is full of hate !!,"Quora used to be my favorite platform back in 2014, mainly because there was so much new to learn and only those people were answering who actually had knowledge regarding the topic ( Professors, Scientists, Military Historians )

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

funn5p,Opinion: What's the point of being religious if it doesn't rid you of basic human vices?,"One of my neighbours and their family are super religious. They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

When they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG. They call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. Nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

This made me think - What's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? What would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

So I know I'm pretty old now but I'm planning to put up profiles on dating websites - I heard Tinder, Aisle and Hinge are good.

And also parents are putting up my profile on shaadi.com, jeevansaathi.com and bharatmatrimony.com.


Please help me with what are your experiences with both!

Have any of you found serious relationships via a dating website - what are the things I can do to be safe on there.?

And have any of you actually gotten married via above mentioned matrimonial sites?
Will it be bad if I am the one operating the profile, I know people tend to be pretty conservative!",False,aragornislove,Non-Political,189,2020-03-02 19:13:57,349,0,"I don't think 28 is too late. It depends on how soon you want to get married, and what's the age range you are looking at. Plenty of guys in the 28-34 age group would look at women of your age, for instance. And if you are willing to take it slow and be patient, then 28 years is not late by any stretch.

I don't have any experience with matrimonial sites, but I have used dating apps across different Indian cities and other countries. I do know of people who have had serious relationships with people they met on these apps. I, too, have dated women from these sites over a decent length of time.

I would say one's experience with Tinder/Bumble/OKC (these are the 3 that I've used) depends to an extent on how we shape it. And you will definitely find interesting guys on these dating apps who would be willing to ""get serious"" if it feels right. You will have to wade through a lot of random profiles, unsolicited messages/pictures (I am saying this based on some of the things my Tinder dates have shared with me about their experiences). But it is possible to find serious folks too. 

Put up a few representative pictures, add some profile info, swipe right in a wise manner, and do message/reply if the profile seems interesting. At a general level, it is about finding a middle ground between what you want in terms of a larger goal (long-term relationship/marriage/short-term), with what the guy you are interested in is willing to offer. 

You will have to wade through a lot of random profiles, which initially may seem exhilarating in terms of the sheer number of matches. So be prepared for the long haul (3-5 months) to find something more serious. 

Good luck with the hunt! ",,True,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fc7h8e/dating_and_matrimonial_sites/

* He has acted in 208 movies. All as the lead with 95% of them being box office hits. 
* He won a national award for playback singing. 
* He won a doctorate for acting. He was also the first Indian theatre personality to be awarded as Kentucky Colonel by the USA. 
* He has acted in a single language, Kannada, for over 50 years. 
* He has over 5000 fan association all over the world and there are over 2000 statues of him. 
* All his 208 films had a U certificate. 
* He never dabbled in politics even though the only time he did during the Gokak agitation, there was an ocean of people ready to do what he said. 
* He has played every role you can imagine. From mythological and historical characters like Krishna, Raghavendra Swamy, Arjuna, Santa Tukaram, Purandara Dasa, Bedara Kannappa, Krishna Devaraya to playing an adaption of James Bond, he has done it all.

Both country's foreign intelligence services (in this case, it's the ISI and the R&AW) directly report to the Prime Minister and in Pakistan's case it also reports to the Army Chief along with their Prime Minister.

So, there is no doubt that Modi is directly exposed on the Kulbhushan Jadhav thingy as he easily could've burned down the whole network if it was indeed set up before his term started in 2014.

So, to me if the ISI sponsored terrorism claims are true, then both countries are complicit in stirring up some shit to use their population as a voting bank. Obviously an invasion is never going to happen because both countries have nuclear arsenal to just fuck everything up.

I mean at this point there is no doubt in the R&AW sponsored terrorism case. Denial won't change the fact that he merely survived because Pakistan didn't read him his rights and didn't give him a lawyer as India just denied him being even remotely related to India.

filcke,I realised (definitely just a bit of it) yesterday how creepy we Indian men are .,"This happened yesterday morning. I use a bicycle to travel to work. So en-route as I reached one of the traffic lights, there was this guy on some 4-5 year old splender idling his bike on zebra crossing.

I stopped some 1/2 feet  before zebra crossing. Now we we were the only two guys on that side. Some 15 seconds later a girl on activa stops next to me before zebra crossings.

Now this guy starts revving up his engine and started looking back towards his silencer as if checking that there is something wrong with his bike. There was nothing wrong - no black or white smoke. He was just checking out the girl. Then this guy slowly started reversing his bike and placed it before the zebra crossing between me and that girl and kept revving his bike for other 20 sec till lights turned green. 

Whille he was reversing and revving I had a feeling that he was doing this as a show-off. The girl and I happened to look at each other and her expression seemed to say ""yes I know what he is doing"" as if reading my mind.

As the light turned green they happen to turn in different directions and that guy might have followed her if they were going the same way, I relaxed a bit but it creeped me out.

I will not try to be holier than thou. I also checkout girls and I am sure girls also checkout boys - which is normal. But I do that very discreetly and never have been the one indulging in catcalling or someone who stares till the girl disappears in the crowd or ""ghar tak chod kar ayenge"" types.

It is normal to checkout individuals from opposite gender but catcalling and staring to make other person uncomfortable is not.

We Indian men need to understand this.


Edit 1:

Seems like this post has divided opinions.

A) Some people are shouting out about this post being generalising for all Indian men.

I want to make it very clear -

I pointed out the issue and not singled out the person.

 when I used the term ""Indian men"" I was referring to those who indulge in such attention seeking gimmicks. And if you do not do that I didn't call you out.

And if you are not satisfied now, then come let's nitpick the skin from hair. 

B) There are others who are taking the side of the other guy and are pointing out that it may just have been an issue with his bike.

Which is a fair point. But is based on presumption.
And for that I would say two things:


        1) I develop engines and can tell you if something is wrong with the engine. I am very sure everything was fine with that bike.



        2) This happened in chandigarh and if you have a idea about Gedi culture here you will know what such signals are meant for. And I know what that meant

C) Lastly, those who understood this thanks for trying to reason with others

**EDIT 2:**

This is getting out of hand

**To all the NOT ALL MEN brigade**


Hear me out and answer this honestly to  yourself (do not post here if your ego hurts).
Whenever you go out with your girlfriend, sister or any female relative of yours don't you always have to look out for male leching?

If you do not then you are living in a really good place my friend. But if you do that ,then what you are assuming is that all men will want to look at them. You yourself think that sub-consciously that ""All men will do this"".

g5w2c7,Self-loathing,"I'm a young guy born to a typical Indian middle class family. Most of my relatives conflate psychiatry with sorcery. Their thoughts sometimes are repulsive. I've for a while now suffered from self-loathing. This detestation of who I am manifests in my actions.

 I'll sacrifice my desires to please others because there's an ingrained feeling that I'm worthless. It's this irrepressible desire to appease others. That craving for approval maddens me.

I find no joy in my achievements because I tend to compare myself with others. It's indubitable that there'll always be people more successful than us. Intellectually I understand it but unable to internalise it. My acquaintances encourage me to utter affirmations. But they've been sterile. Utterly ineffective.


My passive-aggression repels me. Until not too long ago I wasn't aware of my tendencies. A good samaritan sat me down and elucidated what I was suffering from. I started dispassionately observing my behaviour and I've sensed a pit in my stomach when I don't receive the approval I crave.
I'm encouraged to love myself. But it's a cryptic expression. I've watched countless videos by these soi-disant motivators. The more I watch them the more I hate myself. I've been encouraged to visit mental health professionals. But I cannot at this stage.

fnh884,The Narrative Structure of a WhatsApp Forward,"With a global pandemic on full swing and lockdown on many cities of the nation, I, like most citizens, have locked myself behind the doors of my house.
With so much time on my hand, thanks to quarantine, I started reading numerous WhatsApp forwards to entertain myself. These messages contained a trove of erroneous information but were so hilarious I overlooked them. 


Soon, I started noticing similarities in these messages. So, I decided to find out what ingredients these messages use and are there any underlying structure for these messages.


After reading, analysing, and breaking down a lot of such messages, here’s what I found:


**These messages contain**:


1)	 Appeal to the reader’s pride in national and cultural heritage:    
> A very important reason these forwards work is the emotional appeal in them. The messages implore the readers by using words like ‘Countrywide efforts’, ‘mentioned in Puranas/Vedas’, ‘Proud to be an Indian’,  etc.


2) 	Claims supported by a prestigious scientific organisation, astrological events, or philosophical reasoning:    
> Your mentions of NASA, UNESCO, WHO, etc. come here. But these are not alone. Mentions of astrological events like Amavasya, Poornima, the position of planets and stars, etc. also find their way in such messages.    
> It is a very simple trick to make an unsuspecting reader trust the information in the message.


3)	 Use of first-person plural pronouns:    
> Plenty of these messages are written in first-person plural pronouns. It is an easy trick to allow the reader to connect with the emotions behind the message because of the first-person pronouns and plural ‘we’ or ‘us’ gives the reader a sense of belonging. The reader feels that they are not alone and are a part of a group.


4)	 The germinal idea:    
> The most important thing in the message is the ‘germinal idea’. It is the information the message has to spread. The idea is worded simply and can be summed up easily.


5)	 Lastly, emojis of the Indian Flag, Namaste, Aum, etc. also crop up in these messages from time to time.


**The narrative structure**:    


Now that I knew the ingredients these messages employ, I moved on to understand the way they appeared in the message. Was there a formula to structure the above-mentioned ingredients into a cohesive message? I decided to use the popular ‘Rule of 3’ to understand the structure.


The message is, usually, divided into three parts ‘The Hook’, ‘The Butter’, and ‘The Noose’.


**Part 1 - The Hook**:    
The reader may have a very small attention span, and so the message has to hook them early on. This is usually done with an interesting statement to communicate the germinal idea, but sometimes the names of scientific institutions like NASA, UNESCO, etc. can act as the hook too.    
Not everyone will read the complete text message and therefore the germinal idea has to appear as early as possible.


**Part 2 - The Butter**:    
Although, the reader is hooked and the germinal idea is communicated, but the chances that the reader is completely sold on the idea is very low.    
Therefore, The Butter provides the message with a credulity. This is done by mentioning the names of various institutions, person, equipment, or astrological events.    
This part of the message is worded to sound like facts but are usually false.


**Part 3 - The Noose**:    
The reader may have bought the facts mentioned in Part 2, but the message needs their blind faith. So, the message now ties a noose around the readers by appealing to their emotions.    
This can be done by using one's pride in nation, culture, history, or religion. This part plays a fairly important role because emotions are powerful enough override to logical decisions.

f0ky4m,[Serious] He flew to India and ghosted me. Found out he got married. Please help me understand the culture.,"Sorry if this isn’t the appropriate place to post this.

I’m an American who was dating a guy from India. We’re both in our late 20s, he’s Catholic, from Kerala, and we had been dating for over a year.

He flew to India to visit his family last September. He said he wanted to go early in the year so that we could spend Christmas and New Years together. But instead he started ghosting me for a couple of weeks and when I wouldn’t stop texting him as I was worried, he finally replied with a long breakup text. He said his parents were retiring and so he was moving back to India forever to help his parents move, and said he had no choice but to break up with me and wants me to move on.

I recently found out from his Whatsapp photo that it wasn’t true at all…in reality he just got married, and he's still working in the states. I have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message -- his text was the last piece of communication between us.

I’ve read in passing that it’s not unheard of for NRI's to dump their foreign girlfriends right before they tie the knot with someone in their community, so easily like it’s some sort of past time. And then it becomes this deep dark secret they laugh about with their mates after work. Please tell me this isn't true? When I told our mutual Indian friend about this, he (the friend) was more in disbelief/shock by the fact that it happened to me rather than *what* had happened.

I’m torn between feeling devastated vs. feeling pure anger and hatred like I was just manipulated by a sociopath for over a year. We were each other’s best friend, we loved each other, made a bunch of other forever-promises that couples do… Or was he just practicing for his future wife...",False,throwra40,Non-Political,1384,2020-02-08 15:38:47,413,2,"Maybe he had some pressures from the parents.

There should not be any harrasment from the police when the public needs their support.,"I don't know if there is a system in place to screen people who apply for the job, if it's there it needs to improve if not then put in place. This just shows the mental health of these people. They are no more than gundas in the uniform and we do not need those people. 

I want these people be kicked out of the force because of them people are worried /scared more then they need to be.

Please note that he said the 'cure' is already in the testing phase and will be approved within the year. Please note he said this is 2016. Please note that he said that the cure had been 'proved' - in 2016. 

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

With recent increase in support for the discord app, I thought it would be wise to inform as many as we can about discord user data retrieval process

I know Indians tend to be ignorant about security and their data. We usually don't care who take our data but it's time we start reading privacy policy. Be smart.

fzzcgy,Endlessly refreshing for BigBasket delivery slots? Created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,"**Live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

If you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

fmhuqs,Whatsapp unkils are becoming too powerful,"Just 3 hours ago,

A medical scientist researching Infectious Disease, for the US Government in Houston who was my classmates in college.

And our friendships are equally deep after his departure to America.

Got a call from him.

His first sentence was,

""Devendra Ji,

* Our PM Modi is some great man, probably.

I said

""Hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

He said, ""We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

I asked, ""Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars, leftists, Muslims, Thukde Thukde Gang, Urban Naxalites, Award Returning Gangs, AAP, NDTV etc in India?""

He said, ""Oh nothing like that, I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years, My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees, But the hearts are still Indian.

Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics, I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, But in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi.

You would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular,

All scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

In such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, Currency notes, files, courier parcels, Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi, Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday,

* The country will be almost free from viruses! * These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi, then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. ""*

I could not even speak a word.

Here, crores of people of my country are making fun of Modi, Humiliating him as illiterate,

There are a couple of things I like here, namely the cheap economy, cheap rent, great housing in newly constructed apartments, great infrastructure with water, gas and electricity.

I'm from a top-tier engineering college and have a decent pay.

Looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended Bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category I'd be looking for) and should be my choice above NCR. Some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

Here's what I pay for in Noida -

Rent for 3 BHK (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. Electricity is cheap. Gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

g3pod7,Do you guys have questions for your OBGYNS that they do not have time for? I'm an OBGYN and I have the answers,"Hey Guys,

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

I seriously think that an average middle-schooler who has even the slightest experience with the web can probably come up with better overall design. And the implementation? *Shudder*.

&#x200B;

[Poor UX of a fairly popular Indian bank's online platform](https://reddit.com/link/ftn4l0/video/feawzp2jfhq41/player)

As seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. And input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box. Form generally follows function, but seems like the developers at [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/corporate-banks/) were more concerned with adding wave effect to the buttons, and slide transition to menus than actually testing their rubbish. I'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious UI, but you get the gist.

If they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, I wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

There's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. Do you append a number to your password and increment it? Well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05). I feel for the non-tech-savvy folks who are probably writing their passwords down somewhere instead of using a manager. Some banks double down and require separate sign in and transaction passwords, each with its own rules, naturally.

From what I know, the drug has side-effects and it's efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.


As a layman, I had the following questions:


- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?



- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))



- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.



- Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions?

fuv5y8,How bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for IOC,"# How bout a Quad-nation Aircraft Carrier Strike Group?

***By: Kartikeya Semwal***

With the ever-increasing threat posed by China’s PLA Navy in the IOC (Indian Ocean Region), neighbouring countries like Japan, South Korea and Australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).

[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

But more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

Guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn’t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. 

[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

Indian Navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India’s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.

[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

But there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China’s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

One point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin’s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce’ modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. 

But again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won’t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won’t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). 

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

On the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts. 

[JSDF \(Japan\) Navy Ships during Malabar Exercise with India.](https://preview.redd.it/nfgdxqrhftq41.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db24b91d1148a6ea32964162d21cd14b4c83df3)

Now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.",False,ReadwithKartikeya,Science/Technology,15,2020-04-05 04:34:14,11,0,"The statue earned 82.51 crore after 1 year of it's opening. And if you are that much worried about statues, why don't you ask the Chorgress Party to remove 50% of Gandhi's statues & donate that money to PM's Relief Fund to fight against Covid-19? There are separate funds for separate issues, don't expect 1 ministry to divert funds to another ministry.

fko55s,I hate my college and I am extremely depressed. What do I do?,"  

I should have worked hard in my 11th and 12th and cleared JEE, I admit. There is no good education in India outside of the IITs and only handful other elite institutes. I was a bright student in primary school and had big dreams and high expectations. But something happened after 10th and it all went downhill there on.

I am a first year undergrad studying physics in a shitty university. I love physics and I hope to have a good career in the field. But going to college only demotivates me. It is a colossal waste of time. The teachers are all stupid who very likely bought their PhDs. They don’t even know the basics. I am forced to put up with their bullsh\*t everyday, goddammit. Every lecture feels like a torture. I am an honest, sincere and a hardworking student (not bragging) and I don’t deserve what is happening to me. I don’t see how I am going to be a good physicist without a good teacher or mentor. 

I am severely depressed and have also thought and almost acted on killing myself. I got no friends and my family can’t really do anything to help me. I can’t change or quit college because 1) it’s too late now, I have already lost one year to depression and poor health 2) it is going to be the same elsewhere too and 3) it is a really bad idea to quit college in India. There is nothing around to keep me motivated. I am thoroughly fed up and feel like running away from here. I am very scared for my future.

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

fhzemo,The hardships of creating a completely anonymous account,"This is just a sharing a recent experience of mine while creating this account of mine. This is a complete anonymous account and it has technically no traces of it back to me. This was created on a disposable Kali Linux Virtual Machine using random proxies all over the world! This is technically a throwaway but I kinda like the name I got with it.

The account creation process was already slow due to chaining proxies but then it was pretty slow to verify captcha each time! But it is doable. you need to setup proxy-chains on Kali Linux and configure it using tor's random proxies and then you are kind of done for the network anonymity but then comes the challenge of actually assuming an identity. You have to avoid all the general personal traits while creating the accounts. I chose proton mail for the email client but still it asked for a verification using mobile number! This step took a lot of time as I had to get a phone number which cannot be traced to me but well lets say it was taken care of. After you have a mail id set up and ready to go, you can pretty much get going on to sites which does not require a personal verification using some kind of mobile number. I think authenticator apps can work but I do not have a spare phone which I can load a FOSS OS on so that step is missing.

It is definitely doable, but you have to be very careful just in case you accidentally reveal some important info regarding yourself. This should help any one trying to get her or his word out and are kind of in a fix due to their identity being in a crisis. I would encourage people to be anonymous but be genuine, which is a hard thing to ask for given the anonymity! Kind of a see saw in my opinion, one always goes down when the other comes up. Trust and Anonymity that is.

fbxmmt,WHO findings after trip to China - 5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. We Indians are so fucked if this gets here!,"The WHO has sent a team of international experts to China to investigate the situation, including Clifford Lane, Clinical Director at the US National Institutes of Health. Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:

When a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

China can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

The vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

An examination of 44,672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

Healthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.

Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

Age: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

table placeholder 

Read: Of those infected in China, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). Of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.

Gender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

The new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

Since the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,"" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.

One of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

Finally, a few direct quotes from the report:

""China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",False,Silverballers47,Science/Technology,43,2020-03-02 07:19:23,17,0,I really don't believe it's going to hit us though ...

fuq31g,Roland FP10 and FP30 price/bluetooth functionality in India compared to USA,"I'm from Goa and im looking to purchase a digital piano.

I've gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p-125 from past month now (quarantining my ass off on this comparisons)  
I know the FP-30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think i'll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high !.  
Roland   FP-30 - goes for RS. 72,824 or $952.96   
Roland   FP-10 - goes for Rs. 59,973 or $784.79  
Yamaha p-125 - goes for Rs. 53,189 or $696.02 

I know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry (im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later) and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for (post processing? i dont know the right term for this). Thats why i prefer the Rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action (no i haven't tried them yet, because guess what, noone even has them on display here in the entire state).

My Questions  
1 - Yamaha Or Roland - which will age better? (lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after 4-6 months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same). im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me 7+ years easily.

2- Is that price tag justifiable for roland? i mean should i pay 100$ + just for the 3 key sensors ? 

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- Do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?  
4- Can I just use an addon accessory via the usb to host to transmit the bluetooth data to my computer? because in this case i can then get the yamaha and purchase the accessory.",False,shriommanerker,Science/Technology,3,2020-04-04 22:01:31,6,0,sadhyak full band ! noones picking up calls. i tried already. i'll hopefully visit them after lockdown ends and pick up a keyboard on the spot if its available. mostly at furtados itself. ,,True,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuq31g/roland_fp10_and_fp30_pricebluetooth_functionality/

fmz3lu,"Hello there, I am from the 2020 iGEM Team from IISER Tirupati. Help us combat the rising nuisance of Anti-Microbial Resistance around the world.","Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), simply speaking, is when microbes in the environment gain resistance to existing antibiotics due to rampant overuse of said antibiotics. As a result of AMR, drugs become unusable, leading to loss of life and more side effects. Although it may not seem to be the biggest problem in the country right now, what with SARS-Cov-2 and the growing political divide in India. But it will be a severe problem in the times to come. it is projected, by UN Ad hocInteragency Coordinating Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, that by the year 2050 AMR solely will cause 10 million deaths and by 2030, AMR could also force about 24 million people intoextreme poverty.

If this problem alarms you in any way, then please consider helping us, the 2020 iGEM Team from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati. Internation Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) is an international competition held each year at MIT, Boston. It focuses on synthetic biology ideas that can be commercialised.

I have a dedicated server with GoDaddy that I use to host simple wordpress sites. One day I randomly decided to log into the server to check one of the sites and realized that I was unable to access the hosting. After sometime with tech support I was able to log in only to realize that my entire data was wiped clean. At first, the tech support tried to blame this to some ""hacking"" incident but when I kept asking for details such as the method of hacking, ip addresses used and other info, they reluctantly opened a support ticket. A day later they came back with a response saying that there was a problem with the server and they were moving the data which they lost somehow. They lost 25 sites that were hosted and didn't even offer an apology.

2. We are doing better than Pakistan na (BJPwallas).",False,The_Heartland,Science/Technology,8,2020-03-09 17:33:15,2,1,"As a student, I can name a few ways to improve the quality of education:

1. Give more free time to students to explore extra curricular stuff

I want to get into research and I find very less time to actually study what I want. I'm busy with submissions, assignments and exams instead. I have to stay up at night to learn what I actually want.


2. Teach well known stuff instead of obscure stuff with very few resources no matter how relevant it is

This results in the classes being there only source of information and it ends up being a problem if the teacher is incompetent.


3. Hire competent teachers who know their subject AND they should be able to teach it as well

I know many teachers who don't know stuff but I also know teachers who know stuff but can't teach. Both categories make awful teachers and their classes end up being waste of time (which you can't bunk because you need 75% attendance)


4. Encourage good research

Most of the good research in India is happening in top IITs, IISc, IISERs etc. NITs, private universities should encourage students to do more research which is actually relevant instead of publishing papers just for the sake of it. Publishing trash papers will just increase the research paper count.


5. Reduce ""tech rush""

Many people from non computer fields take a few online/offline courses in computer stuff and apply for tech jobs. They don't learn anything worthwhile in the courses apart from how to use a software and they create problems for people who studied CS/IT for 4 years and have much deeper knowledge. This also creates job vacancies in non computer jobs.


6. Improve quality of exams

Don't ask students to memorize stuff. They'll have access to Google for the rest of their life. Give them basic info and test their innovation.


7. Remove reservation

I mentioned this last because it's contraversial (and I say this with pure academic intent and don't want to offend anyone) but placing average people with above average people is an Injustice to both. Average people struggle to match the above average people and the above average people learn simpler stuff so that average people don't have a hard time.

fkvenf,Google Pixel Quality Control and the scam pertaining to after sales service by conducted by b2x,"Dear Readers,

In early 2017 I created a post on reddit which was something like- Think hard before getting a Pixel in India, after having nightmarish experience with HTC service centre. Now after almost three years, I am creating this topic, which will show you what I meant then, give it more substance and additionally will reflect what scam is being conducted by its third party service provider namely B2X. Kindly take the time to read it in full.

• May, 2017: I purchased a Google Pixel XL from Flipkart effectively for Rs. 43,499 (Price was Rs. 53,499 but there was a ridiculous exchange offer of Rs. 10,000 on Asus Zenfone 5).

• July-August, 2019: The phone was running fine during this period of 2 years 2 months but suddenly the microphone crapped out. Obviously the tech world was already known with Google Pixel 2016 infamous microphone issue which Google themselves acknowledged and with respective lawsuits affected users are getting up to USD 500 refund in the US. Anyhow, I called support and they arranged a pickup and afterwards I received a service charge quotation of Rs. 3,251 from B2X. I initially rejected to pay, as the issue is acknowledged by Google and proven as a hardware defect. But their team lead somehow sweet talked me out of it, sir, we will also change the motherboard of the device within that cost and so on. So I paid the amount.

https://i.imgur.com/90XqwD5.png

I receive the phone back, expecting it to repaired and extremely tensed that they might have put scratches on it, as mine was in immaculate condition even after two years of usage, I unpack the Fedex box and shocked! That's not my phone. A phone which is wrapped in plastic sheet and 'looked like a brand new device', of 128 GB no less. I was over the moon for like an hour. It was totally discharged. I charged it and turned it on and found it was running the Nougat firmware still. Whatever, I started using it in full cheerful state. Google customer support zindabaad.

Update: Google customer support sent me a email dated 23 Mar, 2020, acknowledging that the replacement device they sent me back in August, 2019 was indeed a Factory-tested device, worth of Rs. 17,999 only. So nutshell is- without even informing me they sent me a refurbished device. Fantastic. 

• December, 2019: Not even four month passes, and this replacement device now has a broken vibration module out of the blue. Vibration is the only mode I use on my phones so I couldn't ignore it. Called Google support again, another pick up and this time B2X quoted me a service charge of Rs. 1,539, in which the actual hardware costed like 400 rupees only and the rest was there service charge with tax, Lol. Anyway, I paid it.

https://i.imgur.com/IwDv7EO.png

• January, 2020: Less than a month passes by, the vibration motor is dead again. I said OK Google, Assistant doesn't trigger, no kidding......I called the support again and another pickup was conducted and this time they repaired the vibration module for free. As they didn't have any other option as it was within 30 days from last service.

• 04th March, 2020: It has been 20 odd days since the last service, now the phone at one fine morning suddenly died on me. I mean I was watching a Linus video or something, and it just rebooted once, pops up on homescreen and then totally goes blank. I was pretty sure the battery crapped up or something. But no, it never turned back on, no matter what I tried. So I do the obvious, call Google support again and yet another pick up and now the main point, this time around B2X has initially quoted me a service charge of Rs. 25,104 (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand One Hundred and Four only). I was what? Then someone calls me over phone and tells me there is a discount on this and the revised service charge will be of Rs. 21,724. I said outright to him that I will not be paying a single penny and I will be initiating legal steps.

https://i.imgur.com/LhFIog9.png

To sum up; I have paid Rs. 43,499 for a Pixel XL in May, 2017. The device then crapped up with the infamous microphone issue which is Google's own manufacturing defect and the same acknowledged two years down the line, I paid Rs. 3,251 for it. In return which I received a device 'looked like a new phone'. Barely four months pass, the vibrator failed, for which I paid Rs. 1,539. Then the vibrator fails again, no charge this time. So a total of Rs. 4,800 down the drain for service charge only. And now, then want me to pay Rs. 21,724 rupees, to repair my phone as motherboard replacement cost. 

Justify this, you pay Rs. 50,000 (original price plus service charge) and then in the end you have a dead device and to make it un-dead B2X/ Google wants Rs. 21,724.  I have already emailed them, tweeted them but no reply, yet, and their sugar coated replies by the customer service are made in a way to lure you in, like before sending in the phone this time, they assured me, sir, this time the problem will be completely taken care of and you will have no problems in the future whatsoever. And this is them taking care of the problem. I am certain there is no connection between the customer care and B2X. B2X runs its own dirty games, either with or without Google's connivance.

This post was created to gain traction, that is it. No other purpose it is meant for. I really don't want to hear opinions about how Chinese OnePlus minus or meme company phones are better, I am not into those, I will never be. So anyone caring about Pixels, the camera and the software experience (which is hands down sublime, but still outdone totally by the pathetic hardware quality control) kindly do me a favour. Vote this post up, so that it can be seen by as many people as possible and share this post in other places if you kindly. Also, if there are other places where I can post this topic which will gain more traction kindly advise me of the same, I will be grateful to you.

g79laj,I am getting robbed by magicbricks. What should I do?,"Hello guys,  
I am very frustrated with MagicBricks. This is a throwaway account.

I desperately needed money so I decided the best way would be to sell my shop through MagicBricks.

I bought their super titanium package for 13650 Rs on 18th March Evening. (Before lockdown)  

https://preview.redd.it/84599e4dvru41.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c78b5e1b42171a683dda9a44e41276cb8f46970

&#x200B;

Now, I never received their services. The ad never went live. The photoshoot and other services were never received due to lockdown. I am also not able to visit the shop due to lockdown. Interested buyers also won't be able to visit the shop due to lockdown.  


So I asked for a refund by calling them. They created a support ticket and this is the email I received.

https://preview.redd.it/ofcudzvavru41.jpg?width=1586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0870d803967eb4ba8ec4924478d34ed96651236

  
They say the ad was on hold as per my confirmation. Without photoshoot, content writing, how is the ad suppose to go live?  On the other hand, they say they are now going to run the advertisement/services by the end of the day.  
No interested buyer would be able to visit the shop till lockdown. I replied to their ticket.  


https://preview.redd.it/91926q1ovru41.jpg?width=1573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0cf7b99d681d2a7e20faa34ea24de9a29812c2b

I replied to them that I want a refund, and this is their reply.  


https://preview.redd.it/e3n1g1sovru41.jpg?width=1562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c99a714487b04eb6e7a99753089f98ba18dbd27

They are now claiming that I have utilized their services, which I obviously haven't and couldn't! They now have enabled services. Without any good photos on the ad, there will be hardly any interested buyers Plus no interested buyers will be able to visit my shop due to lockdown. 

I am forced to delay my plan to sell the shop for a few months.  

I do not have much money left with me. It would take a few months for the shop to be sold. I am a small failed businessman, the banks & other entities won't lend me personal loans or any other loan without collateral. I feel I don't have any option anymore other than getting a loan on collateral.

Since I need money urgently, I cannot afford to wait for months. I have to cancel my plan to sell the shop and get a loan on collateral.  


Running ads at this time would be a total waste of money for me.  


If they provided their services earlier and failed, I'd still understand. However, They haven't provided me service and won't refund me. And now after over a month, when I asked about refund, they are going to run ads during the lockdown.

fxb9zh,"Finance Basics – Share Market,Mutual fund, Insurance","Lets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. Share Market –
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. Insurance :
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

But only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges .

ftybqp,PSA: Don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,"I see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
When you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      

Credit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",False,ChelshireGoose,Business/Finance,125,2020-04-03 14:16:16,23,0,"Reduce debt as much as possible. Debt+economic crisis is one way street to endless economic hardship for individuals. Moratorium is useful for people who have lost jobs or businesses that have gone offline, but there's no relaxation on the interest.

fupeo0,We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",False,abbawaddadu,Business/Finance,84,2020-04-04 20:57:55,21,0,Agree.

fxmvof,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds

I want to solve this problems 

- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 

- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 

- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 

Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 

By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 

- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.

- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.

- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 

- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they don’t use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 

- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.

- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

As someone who has worked in the financial industry 

1. Every single bank branch of every bank has to physically move the excess cash ( from the branch alloted level) to it's currency chest ( think of it as a rbi repository).

2. For the above, counting of cash happens at various levels each day . A person physical verifies all the values with the counting machines and system values.

3. Security at the currency chest (where the bank's physical cash is stored) , which is bomb proof with zero power cuts 24/7 365 days a year. 

So you have no clue the money bank's spend to ensure physical cash is managed properly.

All private banks have cash deposit charges over a certain limit every month, to reduce physical cash movement.

Banks have invested like insanely money on online banking facilities because physical branches cost a fuckton of money. 

So it's fucking god's gift to bank when people move towards virtual banking as compared to physical movement of money. 

So why then banks chose to increase charges for upi ?

Crony Capitalism states that  revenue never decreases. So while bank saves shitton of money , it doesn't count for stock market and revenue must keep increasing. So they have to find new ways of charging people. 

They will increase the cost of upi , they will charge for cash deposits also , they wil charge you for atm .As long as most banks do it , they feel safe. 

So it's a false notion that the money invested for upi has to be recovered from upi transactions only. ",,False,False,False,https://inc42.com/buzz/upi-slowdown-incoming-banks-to-charge-up-to-inr-5-after-20-transactions/

ft2tfm,Moving back to India - salary breakdown question,"Hi all, I came to US for masters and have worked there for few years and I am planning to move back to India soon and have been offered a job role. This will be my first job in India and I have some very basic questions:

I am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - I have been offered a base salary and along with that I get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.

1. For house allowance - do I have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? Or do I have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?
2. Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?
3. How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

Basically trying to understand how much I can expect to get as a salary deposit in my account

fo4779,A dialogue for Indians to understand why bitcoin even exists,"**TL;DR Owner of a bank or financial institute can change the amount of money in the financial system (modern money is just a number in the banks database), while manipulation of this nature is impossible on block chain**

**Given the current Indian financial market situation me and a friend had this dialogue to try and understand if bitcoin is of any use to us.. may be it helps you start a conversation with someone else and get a better understanding of things.**  

I’m a stock market trader and recently I was talking to this friend of mine who is into bitcoin as  well as the stock market.. 

He asked me if I knew why bitcoin was needed in this world.. 

And my answer was.. An alternate currency

Turns out it’s got an actual reason for existing

**BTC is an alternative to fiat currency? or “store of value” like how Gold is?**

But Bitcoin is not like Gold at all. 

* Gold is valuable as a metal. 
* It is soft, malleable, 
* very good conductor of electricity, 
* safe to the skin unlike copper and does not tarnish over time. 
* If we needed gold in large quantities and cost wasn’t a problem, we can actually create gold in particle accelerators. So it's not a matter of gold being scarce

**Bitcoin has no physical value like gold. Bitcoin is all digital.**

&#x200B;

**A Simple Though experiment:**

Let’s assume I open a bank called DVZ bank and people have deposited a total of Rs.1,000 with my bank. 

* Now people and corporations come to me asking for loans and I give them a combined loan of Rs. 10,000. 

Where did the extra Rs.9,000 come from? 

You decide whether this is a problem or not for a financial system.

**As it turns out, in the modern world, money is just a number in a bank's software. It can be tweaked any way the controlling authorities want.**

As an authority, without a few people in my pocket, I  could set up a XYZ business just for the purpose of creating money. XYZ business would never make a single rupee in profit but we will keep adding new money into the XYZs bank account every month. It's our bank. Our software. Our database. Who is to stop us? 

Whereas Blockchain is a self-regulating database. 

**Once an entry is made into the blockchain, it can not be edited without destroying the whole database. It maintains integrity by nature.** 

**So, if 21 Million bitcoins are coded into the database, it cannot ever become 22 Million Bitcoins. Whereas in any other currency or banking platform it can be changed.** 

Banks are based on ledgers that can be manipulated by the bank owners and governing parties. 

Bitcoin runs on blockchain ledgers which are immutable.

To break this down ever further, let’s say you have 100 rupees in Paytm Wallet and Paytm’s core developer is your best friend. You can convince him to turn that 100 into 10,000. This cannot be done with Bitcoin, if that is done, the whole database breaks.

Has this ever happened? Paytm has been accused of internal fraud by audit companies multiple times. A Famous incident that can be quickly searched online is where an ex paytm employee created fake transactions in order to earn from cashbacks. Total fraud of over 10Cr. 

The loans given out in Bitcoins will be real bitcoins and not fake money which eventually turns into real money. Banks give out money that they don’t have and don't recover, that leaves a hole in the financial system.

Blockchain is attempting to provide a very clean and efficient financial system, to have a record of what’s coming in and what’s going out. If implemented successfully, we will do away with printing money and bringing in Helicopter money during times like these. It will all be a zero-sum game then.

Your thoughts in comments please (we are figuring this out through a dialogue so please be constructive with the comments, in a way that we learn a thing a two from your comments too)

**NEGATIVES OF BLOCK CHAIN/BITCOIN** 

We came across some negatives for bitcoin too.

If Country has Trillion $ economy.. and it gets burned..by some natural calamity or some other factor

no problem, govt will pump in another trillion into existence and live on.

but if i have million bitcoins and lose the key

It’s gone forever. no chance of ever recovering it",False,freewheelin_zee,Business/Finance,11,2020-03-25 01:50:37,9,0,"It's the rush i suppose..

fyk6e8,A perspective about business that will help you in investment,"Let me give you some perspective of business that will help you identify shares.

When i started a company, it was hard for me to figure out , i used to campaign on my own, later i learnt ,i just have to get more people to work ,and keep getting more campaigns at higher prices.

Now,i just have to focus on two things, people and campaigns. If i have to expand my business ,i have to just increase  both . There is no such innovation needed , innovation just comes on the way. So ,the formula is so simple,you just have to focus on sales and your products. Just try to increase it . And there is no such innovation  needed to expand. You have just do more work , if you are making sales ,do more sales,making something ,keeping making more.

If the share you are purchasing, are not expanding that means they are just not doing the same work more and more ,on which their business is based on. It means they are not focused.

Take a 5 year horizon ,so if they are focused, a year is a long time ,they should increase year on year. They have to just do the same thing more and more. Its so simple. So ,if a business is not expanding , and cannot do that simple thing ,why will you ever invest in it.",False,vikashred,Business/Finance,2,2020-04-11 06:52:55,6,0,"All those cases are of short term

f7b3af,"Loan and interest is unpayable after my dad's demise, need financial advice if any possible,","Mods thanks for letting me post here, but if there is a more appropriate place I should be posting this, rather than here let me know,

Okay, now here's the story, My dad passed away last November and since then it has been a problem to maintain our bills, and it certainly doesn't help that we are under a big home loan, which my dad and mom took couple of years ago, and wasn't able to pay because my father lost his job then, he did try to get a job now and then... And he manage to earn some money to help with the loan, and mine and my sisters study.. my mom also used to work 2 shifts (9-10 hours) 2 different jobs... 

But now the situation after my dad passed away is..

- I m a student grade 12,
- And my mom only works one job in the morning, because she isn't comfortable anymore..

- my mom's salary is less than the amount we should be paying for the loan per month

- he didn't have any life insurance
- the money my mom earns, goes into helping with bills, maintainance, etc. My school fees

- I do have my grandparents with ample amount of money to help us, but for what ever reason they aren't helping right now, it could be the fact if he helps with such an high amount, the members in the family might expect him to divide his wealth next, And I personally don't want that kind of strain in our family.. so we aren't pushing that idea home..

-And the problem is not the home loan, but the other loan we took from different banks to pay are existing loans, (bad decision, i know)

Anyways what i want to know is, that if their is any way we could be helped in this situation, with any law or a program launched by government of some sorts, i just need financial advice on what should be the next step, so their is not a lot of burden on my mom... 

I will be glad to have any help🙏😔

flqirb,"COVID-19 , Business, Impacts and Recession","COVID-19 is a global catastrophe right now. Something we took very lightly in the initial stage as a country, as individuals and as business.

But this hit us in a very unexpected way. Malls which were crowded all the times, are shut. Public transport are running almost empty. 
Everything is so silent outside that you can feel the air is clean. You can actually hear the birds singing. If you pay attention, In cities you can see more stars at night these days. Well, nature has its own way to clear the dirt. 

But we are humans, lets just be mean and think from our perspective. Within a week, the offices are empty. small businesses gave their employees work from home. Big companies are following 50% occupancy rule.

For some time i want you guys to think emotionally and be logical. The scene is bigger than the virus. 

**We are not heading for a recession, we are heading towards depression.**

IT companies who were working on projects which are almost 80% complete. Just have those projects in their hand. which will pay them not more than 25% of the final amount of the proposal.

Projects which were about to start, Have shut, Projects which were between 35-70% completion, are paused. And there are no new projects.

Constructions and real estate sectors in cities have stopped for next 6 months. Big companies, have circulated the mail to small vendors that there won't be any money coming for atleast next 6 months. (Cement, steel, rocks and bricks provider, architects, etc etc) who work on a month or 3 month money rotation, and mind you, even the smallest vendor work for not less than 10 lacks rotation, got no money. These guys are in immediate debts. 

Manufacturing is yet to hit, coz people are still buying stuff. But this will stop in a month. 

Coming back to, people dont have projects to work and money to rotate. They (we) are having funds to sustain our staff for 6 months. But, this works when the world is fine and we don't have projects.
the case is different here. The world is burning and we can see that businesses are not going to get any thing for next 1 year minimum. So this is not the time to think about employees, but to save the company and the investment. 
Employee class is going to get the salary of april. that's it. that's the fact.

Learn it, love it, live it. Byheart it. write it on a paper and stick to the wall, get up and read this everyday. prepare yourself. 

Do not enjoy this time as you are working from home. Use this time to think. Plan your actions, cut your expenses. if you have savings for 6 months, make sure you use it for a year.

Unfortunately, this catastrophe is an opportunity for big companies to layoff thousands of their non-performing employees (NPE). the number will be as big as 60%.
and for small businesses, 80% (small businesses usually dont have NPE, every employee is an asset but its directly proportional to the company's turnover and number of projects).

so lets just take a rough number that almost around 40% - 50% people are loosing their jobs in june-july.

But people who earn daily wages, have started feeling the impact right now. 

Constructions would stop, killing the daily wages of construction workers. Spending capacity will reduce, killing semi luxury utilities like cab/auto, restaurants , travel. 

Do not expect any compensation from government, And for country's good, please dont! 

Country needs money to run. Hospitals, food, maintaining law and order, may be camps, these will suck a lot of money from govt locker.
So don't expect any lone wavers, tax exemptions, bill exemptions or reducing petrol price coz its down world wide.
Yes we can argue that the banks gave loan to some individuals and they ran away and potato potato. What's gone is gone. 
if the government works in our favour, its good. But dont keep any hope.

This week took businesses atleast 6 months back. and in coming days, we are going to loose almost 2-3 years of hardwork and buildup. 

Days are going to be hard. This is not the post to scare people. I dont care about the upvotes or downvotes. 

I feel bad when i see people enjoying work from home. I saw people who were asked by companies 'Office will be shut, you cant take your systems home, if you have laptops, we will install the required softwares to your system and you can continue working'
and people straight away said 'NO' to that.
For your information, Business remembers everything, Thats how business evolves. And business is an entity without heart. 
You guys are the first one the companies gonna layoff. 

Last but not the least, while I was planning, I jotted down a lot of points but while writing, i'm sure I missed a lot. Please feel free to ask any questions you have.

fxpcir,Is this a good deal?,"Hey guys.
Hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
It's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one I'm going to ask now but I really need your help. 
So here's the scene. 

I've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. Basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

It's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. This firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come September. 

Upon speaking to the founder, I found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. We have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

Here's a rough idea of the deal I'm getting offered. 
He's offering me an equity stake in the company. (The valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
My rent and meals will also be taken care of. Transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
In addition, I've asked him that I would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (Sutta, daaru etc) 
This startup is based out of Delhi. 

What I want to know is this a good deal? I've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

I do want to join this startup. It offers me responsibility, and I'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

What I'm confused about is the deal that I'll strike with them. How much equity stake should I ask for? How much salary should I ask? ( They're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
Any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and I can start work at the earliest. 

Please help out a brother in need! 

Cheers and stay safe!",False,haphazardwizardofoz,Business/Finance,6,2020-04-09 22:53:03,3,0,"Any time. Also feel free to shoot a DM for anything you don't want answered in public. 

Apologies for the confusion there. The 5k is based on a 50/50 split of equity and cash. So if you want to take home 10k per month, but they can only pay you 5k per month, the other 5 should be paid in equity. 

It's a pretty crude way of determining equity based on what you would be earning in that role at another company if you were paid in full each month.

Hope that helps! ",,True,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxpcir/is_this_a_good_deal/

fqfr2a,"Yesterday, many Indian retail traders got caught trading on the wrong side after Nifty opened 3.56% gap up ? Why did that happen and can you avoid it going forward ?","Yesterday, most of the big and seasoned traders of Indian Stock market were either selling puts or buying calls at the market open expecting the market to go up. As these big traders have huge fan following on various social media platforms so when they shared their market analysis many small retail traders followed them and got trapped.

This is post is just to warn small retail traders who blindly follow big traders and try to copy them. The experienced and seasoned traders have their risks calculated behind every trade they enter into and even if the trade goes wrong they have firefighting skills in order to exit at breakeven or with minimum losses.

I would say that instead of blindly following others spend time in enhancing your trading skills and observe live charts daily to sense the market moves on your own. When you know the reason behind a trade entry then you will be more confident about it instead of taking a trade posted by someone else.

I am also a retail trader just like everyone else out there. But I trade based on my analysis and to give you yesterday's example my analysis was saying there will be correction at the market opening and thus exactly at 9.17 AM I posted below tweet from my Twitter account.

https://preview.redd.it/dorscic86dp41.jpg?width=598&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a842da909215c271e429d6436ea55e2b18f3247

Moreover, at around 9.43 AM I was bearish on the market and had published another tweet related to #banknifty futures which is as follows.

**What did market do after this ?**

\#BankNifty futures faced resistance 3 times from the exact same level (21057) which was posted well in advance and corrected more than 1300 points from there.

No, I am not talking about voting per se, but custody of the shares. In Ibdia you have NSDL CSDL etc  (govt companies) which give the share holder full control. This system is not there in the USA, the custody is with the brokers itself. So if the broker collapses, you can possibly lose access and being in India you will be stuck running around to get back control. 

Otherwise I have a decent amount in tech shares USA via vested. Im just refraining from loading a big portion of my folio into that for the above reason

You have to set your mindset what type, duration of investment you want to do and also from a taxation standpoint.

Nobody in sane mind has ever recommended Franklin Templeton debt funds without saying yes they are more riskier than other AMC. They also have a solid track record of return in their debt funds, it's only this year they have started coming up with issues. 

It's not about investing in US stocks because they have better management. You have to keep in mind to diversify your assets. 
The market also backs this up. Downturn is limited and in long term it's only going to get up unless you think economy is going nowhere.

Regarding Liquid funds if you noticed some have posted 0% nav movement yesterday and previous week. Are they safe , yes absolutely. If you are looking for the safest then please go with Parag Parikh Liquid fund which mainly invests on tbills only.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

I run a small service based company. 
For first 2 years i was opc. Then started with one employee and after 6 i got a team.

This virus affected the people of india in march where they got work from home but we as business owners started getting hit from late January. There were no incoming funds from Feb and no new busines in march. And what can I say about April. May doesn't look bright either.

My company's disaster management fund started getting out from feb and on verge to get exhausted by june. 25k*6 + a co-working space cost which came around 60k for feb and march half month. 

This is unfortunate that this day next month if situation doesn't get better. I'll have to tell them to go on unpaid leave until further notice. 

This is painful. As a human. Coz these people are my people. As a business coz it took me 8 years to be where my company is today. And everything gone in 3 months.

Many companies has laid off their employees already. and in may, its gonna be double.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

g0zink,Key takeaways from PM Narendra Modi’s address to the nations at 10 AM on 14th April 2020.,"## Key points said
- Nation's fighting well, thanks to you folk's sacrifice. ""We the people of India"" means exactly this [Starting till 4 minutes in speech].
- India started screening for COVID before the first case. At 100 cases, we started isolation. At 500 cases, we did a lockdown for 21 days [6 minutes in speech]
- It's unfair to compare with other countries. However, if we compare, India is at a relatively good standing (by around _25 to 30 times_). [8 minutes in speech]. The lockdown and social distancing was expensive but worth it. Still, _the rate of spread is alarming_ [10 minutes in speech].
- Citizens, state governments, bodies have suggested and some have _already_ implemented an extension to lockdown. **Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May 2020** (under the _same circumstances and conditions_). [12 minutes in speech].
- We have to avoid the spread of COVID in regions. Death due to this must be even more worrisome. _We must stay vigilant with current and emerging hotspots_. New hotspots will bring problems. 
    - **Stronger constraints and implementation of lockdown till 20th April 2020**. Essential services and operations can resume for areas of lower risks (under conditions for going out). _If any traces of COVID, the lockdown shall be reimposed_. [16 minutes in speech].
- _A guideline shall be released by tomorrow_ (_15th April 2020_). Major steps are taken to _help the poor and needy_. The government has helped them through various funds, specially farmers. There are efforts being made for helping farmers, supply chain is being improved [18 minutes in speech]
- We've already organized over 1L hospital beds and 600+ COVID hospitals. Scientists are encouraged to help in these times of crisis [20 minutes in speech].

### Help needed in 7 areas 
The public is encouraged to focus on the following areas [start 22 minutes in speech]:

1. _Extra care of the elderly_ in the house
2. **Obey lockdown**. Use **homemade** masks.
3. Improve immunity.
4. Download ""Aarogya Setu"" [mobile app](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/) and encourage others to download it.
5. Help the poor and needy
6. Don't terminate employment of workers under you
7. Respect the front line workers (police, healthcare professionals, etc.)

**Please follow the above till 3 May 2020** [till 24 minutes in speech].

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.",False,IAmMohit,Coronavirus,761,2020-02-12 16:29:51,5566,1,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg)

A mathematician's (3blue1brown) simple explanation of a viral growth curve. We (all countries outside of China) are just at the beginning of the exponential growth phase of Corona virus. Before accusing others of fear mongering and downplaying the risk, watch this video and wrap your head around how exponential growth works. The situation isn't under control by any means. It will soon blow up to ridiculously high numbers within a week. If you don't believe me, look at the graphs here which stand as proof that all the viral growth curves follow the logistic/sigmoid growth curves.

No, it is not more than that, it is the only reason. Kanikaphobia would have become a word if people started boycotting all singers because of her, nriphobia would have become a word if some NRI were lynched.

fp83fz,"Goa is STARVING due to 100% lockdown, and I need you to know about us","I cannot take this anymore! The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

I fully condemn the tablighi Incident, however i do not subscribe to the hatred spewed against ALL Indian Muslims based on that incident. I welcome criminal proceedings against the organizers of tablighi Jamaat who flouted the law, but please do not hold ALL Muslims responsible for the actions of a select few.

Also i think these religious gatherings are not limited only to a single community

All religious gatherings need to be highlighted by the media, if at least to educate the locals and to put pressure on local governments into taking precautionary measures and containment measure to stop the spread of Corona virus.

fsxcdg,We compiled the absolute best ways for Indians to pass time during this lockdown,"For the past few days my team and I have been trying to figure out ways to fight against COVID19 digitally and positively. We believe it’s super important for Indians to stay level-headed & use this lockdown as an opportunity to spend some quality time with their families. In India, as we grow older and start working, we often forget about our old hobbies & the things which we used to enjoy when we were younger. 

This lockdown will last a minimum of 21 days, and everyone needs to find quality activities to fill their schedule with & things to enjoy with their families.


To solve this, [we've launched IndiaSmile](https://indiasmile.org/): A one-stop resource for the best things to do while stuck in quarantine, with a unique indian context. What's more, it's 100% non-profit and open source!


It contains:

* Best movies and TV shows to watch -- Hindi & English

* Home workout tutorials for Cardio, Yoga, Strength, and flexibility.

* Guides and apps for managing anxiety and social isolation

* Community chat to discuss & engage with

* Unbiased, scientific news

* Learning resources 


We're trying to benefit the community by providing carefully curated lists of content to consume and resources to follow, regularly updated by a team of dedicated citizens.


The IndiaSmile WhatsApp communities section aims to provide more social connections by only permitting authentic and positive content. 


We have also added [a tool to check the nearest confirmed covid case to your current safe location](https://indiasmile.org/nearme/).


Tech details: lean PWA (Progressive Web App) using Nuxt, built to have negligible load times and be super performant on all devices (especially the slower Indian ones). Offline first and heavily cached to provide extreme performance. [Completely open source & non profit](https://github.com/IndiaSmile). 


Open to contribution, ideas, and thoughts. How can we truly make this a genuine resource to help every indian successfully go through this unprecedented lockdown?

fqgtb9,This is how losing a war feels like,"I am a doctor. I am currently posted in the 2nd line of reinforcements waiting to be deployed when (not if) the front line falls. We have completed our retraining, attended numerous debriefs, attended workshops on quarantine for yourself and family and discharged most of our inpatients and our wards are converted into isolation wards. Our posting to virus wards has been chalked out and plans for our own quarantine set. Now we just sit and wait.

Currently the cases are being managed by internal medicine and pulmonologist as the front line and other hospitalist like us are waiting in reserves.  The wait is a nerve-wracking one. We know that the numbers by the government aren't accurate and the wave will come anytime anyday. We are constantly checking the dashboard for the new cases trying to predict when that might be. It's terrifying especially when we have stopped most of our daily/ routine work (only emergencies are working) and have all the time in the world to think and ponder. 

The lockdown that was implemented was a good idea but it's just delaying the inevitable. Stopping a virus with Ro 2.5 (approx) is like trying to stop wind, you can slow it down sure but not stop it. Hospitals are trying to get PPE (it's ok atm Atleast here) but when push comes to shove it will be like Stalingrad where conscripts were thrown in front of machine guns without rifles or ammunitions. Testing is also very inadequate similar to what a war time goverment does to keep the morale up by not reporting bad news (which I am sure isn't their intention here). Testing criterias are ridiculous and labs don't test unless you follow them to the letter (their hands are tied). Outbreak in this country most likely won't be like Italy or the US. We don't know how much worse this may get here. Given the population density god help us. 

We are starting to have desertion amongst our ranks. Some have tried and got certificates from other doctors stating to have pre-existing conditions and won't be able to work. In response the Administration has appointed medical boards to look at such cases and decide the risk accordingly.

I have never read any memoirs of someone in a losing side of the war. It would have really helped to know how they fought this hopelessness and gloom that has disrupted our lives. We are constantly hearing  horrific stories from American and Italian doctors in internet and it feels a window to our future in coming days or weeks. I can't talk about this with my parents. I have decided to keep them in dark about this as much as I can. They are constantly checking the numbers in my city and hospital. I think they also know what's coming.

I can only hope for general winter (Indian summer in this case) to stop this overwhelming force or a successful clinical trial that could atleast give us something to fight with.

P.S: 
1. I honestly believe that the government did the best they could, not only ours but across the world. This is just too hard of a foe to best.

ftlbt8,No Justification for Nizamuddeen and Stone Pelting as Muslim!,"I am a Muslim.

If the event in Nizamuddeen was carried forwarded by the ""so-called"" religious leaders despite warnings and information from the Government, then Islaam has nothing to do with what they did. I say ""so-called"" religious leader/scholar because no knowledgeable Muslim would/should knowingly lead his community or any other life to harm for that matter.

Muslims are taught and commanded to not even go to the Mosque for their daily compulsory prayers if they have eaten garlic and have its smell emanating from their mouths. The Prophet (peace be upon Him) said:

> ""He who has eaten garlic should not come to our mosque"" ([Ref](https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/04/riyad-us-saliheen-imaam-nawawi-chapter-311/))

This is from the viewpoint that they do not harm or disturb the other prayer goers in the Mosques. So, how much more serious is the fact that you are told to keep away from praying together, or gathering together for religious purposes so that no harm or infection comes to another person because of you?! 

And there are several other commands to a Muslim to take the utmost care in not harming another life in any manner. One of the verses in the Qur'aan says (what means):

> ""if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind"" ([Qur'aan 5:32](https://quran.com/5/32?translations=18))

Another saying of the Prophet (peace be upon Him):

> “Do not harm and do not reciprocate harm.” ([Ref](https://www.troid.org/ibadah/knowledge/important-materials/523-the-importance-of-intention))

I myself am very consistent with regards to my daily 5 prayers **IN THE MOSQUE IN CONGREGATION**. However, once the situation with Covid occurred and once the orders came in place to maintain social distancing, me and several of us resorted to staying and praying in our homes.

These people felt they're more virtuous thinking that the virus wont harm them and they'll continue praying in congregation? Forget their own selves and think about the hundreds that would've been harmed by a single one of you. There is no defending their actions. **It was and is wrong**. BUT, it is all based on the news I've read that they purposely ignored warnings and orders to disperse.

And to add to that, these (allegedly) Muslim communities, pelting stones at those who are out to help you?! How ridiculous. Bhai.. is se bada chutyaap tho ho hi nahin saktha. That too at a time, when many are (maybe correctly) blaming Muslims of not doing enough during this outbreak of Corona. Aur bhi naam barbaad kar diya. Basically proved whatever you are being accused of.

Another saying of the Prophet (peace be upon Him) that comes to mind, which is related to plague:

> ""If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place."" ([Ref](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/76/43)) [*Unsure about the authenticity of this specific narration. But authentic narrations with similar meaning do exist*]
> 

I have understood this narration in the light that, if you're in a place with the outbreak of plague, then do not leave it so that you don't carry and spread it among others.

**There is no Islaamic justification for these acts**. With regards to the Nizamuddeen event itself;

1. You ignore all the above religious commandments
2. You break the covenant and ignore the rules put in place by those given authority above you
3. You ignore the plea of your fellow humans
4. You congregate for a 'Religious gathering' which in itself is not approved in Islaam, and is considered an innovation (another topic to be discussed entirely). And innovations are censured in the harshest manner with the sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon Him):

> ""Whoever introduces something into this affair of ours something which does not belong to it will have it rejected"" ([Ref](http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=IBD01&articleID=IBD010004&articlePages=1))
> 

> ""and every innovation is misguidance and all misguidance is in the Hellfire."" ([Ref](http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH05&articleID=BDH050003&articlePages=1))

So, as I said. If they did indeed ignore warnings and carried on with their gathering, then the burden is upon them. Islaam is free from their actions. They shouldn't use Islaam to justify their wrongdoing. And I hope the impact of their wrongdoing can be controlled and innocents be saved from being affected with Covid or any other ailment for that matter.",False,kimbokju,Coronavirus,457,2020-04-03 01:47:11,109,0,Bc lehsun bhi na khane do tum.

* All households below poverty line/handicapped /old aged got 120 kg rice for ₹1/per kg. The rice was delivered to their houses.

* All the people eligible for MBPY ( for below poverty line/handicapped/senior citizens) got extra ₹4000 cash to spend on groceries during 21 day lockdown.

* Poor kids studying in “anganwadi” also got some amount of rice and food delivered to them.

* Government Doctors got their salaries of next 4 months, early.

* All the salaries of MLAs and CM of Odisha was donated for the state budget of corona virus treatment.

All of this was done a week before India went to lockdown. In Odisha you won’t see millions of daily wage labourers migrating to their villages right now, despite it being one of the poorer state in India.

fxrbz1,"I have a feeling that, just like Kerala, rest of India will flatten the curve at around 10,000 cases because we’ll never test community spreading cases at all.","
 According to ICMR our current testing strategy is: 

* All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days:

* All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

* All symptomatic health care workers.

* All hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath).

* Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.

It’s crystal clear that we’ve a very restrictive testing criteria that only tests NRIs, foreigners and people who’re in direct with these people, including medical staffs. We are completely masking the community transmission of corona virus, since people who were directly in contact with those people might have come in contact with hundreds of other people. 

An example of this would be recent Nizamuddin Dargah and Shradhdha ceremony incidents where government only quarantined only those people who were directly involved in the events but those who attended these event might have further spread the virus to several other people, Several thousands or way more to be specific. 

One of the attendee of Jamat was a grocery shopkeeper in my uncle’s town, he was recently taken into custody. So, he alone might have come in contact with thousands of people before he was taken into custody. 

Also, last week 2 people died from corona virus in Dharavi slum, where millions of people are jam-packed in a tiny area, they use the same water-taps and toilets, apparently the government only tested 70 people in that slum and 15 tested positive. Which is no-where near the actual numbers, those 15 people might have come in contact with several hundreds or thousands of people in their own slum. 

If this goes on, I believe we’ll completely ignore the community transmission and the fact that “asymptomatic carries” of corona virus are the biggest cause of cases increasing exponentially in developed countries. 

I don’t think, Kerala flattening the curve is something to be happy about (yet). Since, they’ve started rapid testings to check community transmission I believe that might give us a clearer picture of the situation.

Edit: yesterday, they’ve added the criteria of testing symptomatic people, to check community transmission. Hope, it brings a more accurate statistics of infected cases.

To the best of my knowledge and assessment of the situation, we're about to get deluged in a wave of cases for which it is impossible to be adequately prepared. Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

People panic buying food and medical supplies have created a vicious cycle so much so that I doubt if there will be enough meds for the frontline workers. This could potentially lead to more deaths in the healthcare workers, that could secondarily translate to a higher death rate in the patients.

People not taking quarantine seriously. Their actions today will kill many. Mostly their old, young, and sick family members, neighbours, or roommates.

In the meantime there's talk of having us work in makeshift corona wards from where we won't be able to return home. We'll probably stay on campus in recently emptied undergrad hostels. 

I don't mind working on campus and not coming home for weeks, maybe months. I don't mind dying too much either. ( I'm not super high-risk comorbidity-wise. I'm young. I run. But the stress is making me relapse into my smoking habit, and who knows what that might mean with this infection!) But the one thing that scares me shitless is that I don't know who will take care of my dogs at home. 

I hope I'm proved wrong in the coming weeks.

To negate the fatalism, if you're inside, avoiding ALL outside contact, you'll probably be able to delay infection to such time when we'll be better prepared to fight this thing with real world patient data, maybe new meds or even vaccines.

More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

The testing kits have been costly until now. And govt has limited quantities of these, and it tests for free in govt hospitals.

fo5p40,Republic TV reporter is harassing on duty medical staff and misleading viewers,"Hello r/india. I'm an employee of ESIC. Those of you who don't know about this organization please visit here:[ESIC](https://www.esic.nic.in/about-us) . ESIC provides medical and cash benefits to the insured employees and their dependants. It is a statutory body under Ministry of Labour and Employment, GOI. 
Now coming to the incident. This reporter named Jitendar Chouhan without having a basic knowledge about the department is barking like dog. The person who is said to be using fake id is the Medical Superintendent of ESIC Model hospital noida Dr Anish Singhal. He showed his card and this stupid journalist continued barking saying it's a card of an insurance company(ye insurance company nahi hai bewakoof).  He also mixed ESIC with EPFO. Even the police looked confused. These guys didn't even see the card properly. Even the non medical staffs have the same card. He doesn't even know about the organization with 100+ hospitals 8 medical colleges and more than 1000 dispensaries across the country. Such shameful acts by these journalists is really disappointing.

fzus0u,Explainer: The proposed “zones” idea and why it is a disastrous one.,"The government is apparently floating the idea to create zones of three kinds, red, orange and green. Red zones are hotspots with 15 or more cases, and there will be no activity in them. Orange zones have less than 15 cases and they will have limited public activity, like limited public transport. Green zones have no virus cases where restrictions will be relaxed. (They’ve not yet come out with a full list of relaxed restrictions in this)

(Source: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-red-orange-green-zones-to-mark-coronavirus-spots-in-country-2210381%3famp=1&akamai-rum=off)

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green. That means because of the virus’ 2-week incubation period and the fact that it is asymptomatic means that there will be people roaming around without realising they are infected, causing green zones to also eventually turn orange or red. This would be possible if we had better planning, which we DON’T.",False,StorySpiral,Coronavirus,77,2020-04-13 00:29:09,56,0,">There are better brains at work here and must have surely thought this through along with contingencies.
