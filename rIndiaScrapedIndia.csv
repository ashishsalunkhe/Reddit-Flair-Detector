#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

But what I find more outrageous is their people have the guts to manipulate wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil_Kumar_(actor)  ) and phrase it as ""The wedding took place on April 17, 2020[9] near Janapada Loka in Ramanagara[10], but caused controversy as it was held during the extended Janata Curfew""

As far as I know, the janata curfew was voluntary and long back. On April 17, the lockdown and social-distancing was in full effect. But these folks are phrasing it on wiki so damn casually. As if the lockdown translates to janata curfew for VIPs.

Is no legal action being taken against these people for violating the lockdown so blatantly?

g3mehq,India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",kullky_2020,Non-Political,True,,True,False,97,0,False,,,0,2020-04-19 01:30:47,200,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

I am designing a software to help physios save some time, while impacting their income positively. I need some data for that. Please help me with some questions. The following questions are not specific to your practice, but generally about physiotherapy in India.
 
Generally, how many sessions does a person need for his rehab?

What % of patients leave their therapy incomplete?

What would be the reasons for a patient to leave their therapy incomplete?

Generally how much more do home visits cost as compared to patient visiting the clinic?

Do physiotherapy patients have a waiting time at clinic? If yes, what would be the approximate time that patients need to wait for?

What other challenges do patients face in regards to their physiotherapy?

What are the challenges that physios face in their day to day business operations?

How often do physios have to work with multiple patients at one time?

How often do physios have to stretch their schedules/work hours because of excess patients?

How often do physios themselves face occupational hazards like back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain due to manual work or physically demanding sessions?

How many maximum sessions can an average physiotherapist do in a month? I am trying to understand the income ceiling of an average physio.

What are the fixed expenses per month of an average physio?

What are the ways that an average physio uses to cross the monthly income ceiling?",sharmaamit92,AskIndia,False,,True,False,2,0,False,,,0,2020-04-19 17:25:28,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g413z5/need_help_from_physios_here/

India is a stark contrast compared the USA from what I've seen, but that has only made me want to travel there even more. I had some burning questions I would love some answers to. Besides some YouTubers and books, it can be hard to get some valuable information about traveling to India, as most Americans are baffled at the thought of me VOLUNTARILY wanting to go to India, and only think of it as a dirty and extremely poor 3rd world country without even researching the country.

1. Would you recommend doing a guided tour (even though they can be cheesy and touristic at times) for my first time in India or would it be doable to solo travel or travel with a few friends? I've heard India can be very overwhelming for foreigners at first, but I wanted to know your thoughts.
2. What are some safety tips that are actually TRUE and not stereotypical. I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

g3lncu,Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 

Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

I don't really know what to write  anymore in this.

g3n6wq,"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)","  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.

  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.

Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).

I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):

1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.

Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))

Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 

These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",jai_ho_kick,Coronavirus,False,,True,False,0,0,False,,,0,2020-04-19 02:34:45,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

### Relevance for India and What’s Next?

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

g3kiee,Asur : welcome to the dark side is a highly overrated show.,"******************SPOILERS AHEAD******************
So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

I currently use a US based hosting company VPS which is good but for reasons of taxation I am forced to look for a host that charges GST. Also, as most of my websites are for Indian companies, an India based server would result in a increase in ping speeds.

g3kqnp,Sino-Indian Relationship post COVID-19 (DISCUSSION).,"Note: This it a self post and NOT VERIFIED NEWS.
I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement. 

Some interesting articles about the same.

This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",okbitchtrisha,Coronavirus,False,,True,False,2,0,False,,,0,2020-04-18 21:17:29,9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3js4a/make_in_india_how_we_can_help_indians_during_this/

g3ry8v,A dilemma," I know There are similar posts right now on this topic but i am posting this here because i have  asked this  question on Quora and I haven't gotten any answer.I hope I can get an answer on this site.       
 
  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   

His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?  
.Is it worth risking a secure  job for this opportunity?is it feasible?",aclulmpg,AskIndia,False,,True,False,1,0,False,,,0,2020-04-19 07:34:22,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3ry8v/a_dilemma/

g318gs,Why is the Modified Media continuously playing the same propaganda themes again and again? It is by design not by chance. Here are some thoughts on this,"First of all  It's a feature not a bug. And is being consistently working towards its goal.

The way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.

Second it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the ""intellectual level"" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not ""intellectual"". It is by design that the content has been ""dumbed down""

> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? 

> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. 

> What the intelligentsia — or those who today unfortunately 
often go by that name — what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.

> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 

> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


About the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the ""other"",

> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. 

> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.

We were supposed to have our mid semester exams and the lockdown happened. 
So our university forced online classes so they can say they have completed their syllabus. And now they are forcing us to take our exams online when most of the students don't have good internet connection. 

What can we do?

Edit - Some people think I just don't want to give exams. That's not true. I just want them to be offline since online exams will have zero transparency and at the end we will be given a final score. 

And I personally know 10 people in my branch who have really poor access. It's not about me.

Apart from the negatives( communalism ) , even some credible media organisations ( Theprint , Lallantop) etc. are praising his way of handling corona pandemic and also his foresightedness in making policies to make U.P a industrial powerhouse .


Is it a hogwash by Sanghi media to project Yogi as an alternative to Modi or the PR is because of the TRP and clickbaits  which yogi Adityanath gives to news channels and online portals.
Ajay bisht is not a very media friendly person and has gone to the extent of filing FIRs and jailing them, then why a section of media is bootlicking him is beyond my understanding.

So what is the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test has three simple, unambiguous criterias:

* A film has to have at least two (named) women characters in it.

* These women characters at some point of the movie talk to each other.

* They talk about something other than men.

The test has it's inspiration (seemingly) in an 1929 essay by Virginia Woolf.

One of the larger samples tested in 2019 resulted in very few Hindi movies actually passing the same.

I'm not even sure how regional cinema fares in this.

Television all across the country seems like it will fail the same miserably.

While the test has no assurance about the *quality* of female representation in the said movie \ work of fiction - one small incentive is, **it's observed that movies who do meet the criteria are known to perform better financially, than those who don't.**

They will be able to sustain this lockdown for only so many days given the miserable conditions they are living in right now without any savings.

Its as if the government entirely ignored the presence of 4.5 crore migrant labourers. This lockdown reduces the spread of Corona - It is not enough to fight that virus. People with savings might be able to sustain a multiple month lockdown. But for how long does the government expect migrant labourers to live like cattle fed once a day.

g2y0uu,COVID-19: Sree Chitra’s new test kit set to bring sample-to-result time below two hours!,"*Thiruvananthapuram:*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

g2x8rp,Some colony folks had put up barricades blocking locality entrances without any permission from the police or any other authority.,"Another incident from my locality, after the last two that I had posted earlier. Some people hsd closed a bunch of colony entrance roads with bamboo barricades with help from a friend of mine who runs a decoration business. This happened 2 days ago, without any permission from police, and now if anyone needed to go out to buy essentials, they would be forced to use a gulli (small road) just beside the barricade. 

Note: One of those people had stated two weeks ago on the colony WhatsApp group that he had seen a vegetable vendor licking the vegetables, and when he screamed and tried to catch him, he ran away. (I and many of my friends don't believe him, as he is a far right wnger who wants the complete destruction of muslims, judging from some of his past WhatsApp forwards. Also, there's no way a vendor with a heavy vegetable carrying thela can outrun the man who ""saw him licking"")

The problem with the barricades? The people living around that gully road began having problems with everyone going from that side. Infuriated, they put up a barricade as well. 

One of my friends who lives just beside the barricades, just called me and told that a couple of police vehicles arrived and those people were called. They were scolded heavily and were warned to not do anything like this again. The barricades were then removed. 

I was extremely angry at the fact that they didn't even think of other people who live there, while putting up barricades without permission. It was an unnecessary move that didn't serve any purpose. Someone from the colony had reportedly phoned the police yesterday and I'm glad that they were removed.",abhilash1991,Coronavirus,False,,True,False,7,0,False,,,0,2020-04-17 20:58:23,55,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2x8rp/some_colony_folks_had_put_up_barricades_blocking/

g35581,Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",para97k,AskIndia,False,,True,False,22,0,False,,,0,2020-04-18 05:49:56,12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/

g2w8h1,Performance of CM Uddhav in Maharashtra,"Let me say from the onset, I don't conform to an ideology and I'm just trying to understand through a civil discussion. At least in Maharashtra, lots of people have specifically praised UT for his efforts in tackling the situation. 
First off, I absolutely agree that his speeches are much better. His directness and communication is wonderful. But is he really walking the talk? I understand that Maharashtra has major urban cities with a huge influx of foreign and national migrants. Wouldn't he be doing a good job if regardless of that there'd be lesser cases? Maha has 3000+ cases and how can that be translated to a good job? Also the Bandra station issue. If the govt has done a good job for them, why will they want to go back? All of us feel safer in out homes I understand but if everything was being done right, how was it not communicated to the migrants that trains will be running? How were they allowed to get out in such a huge number and allowed to come all the way to the station?",PradyumanACP,Politics,False,,True,False,46,0,False,,,0,2020-04-17 19:37:00,51,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2w8h1/performance_of_cm_uddhav_in_maharashtra/
g33qna,How much testing is enough testing ?,"  
Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?   
Data Source : [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries)   
If you notice China which is our closest in terms of population has played with their numbers to an extent where no one knows whats real or whats not. So what metric can I look at and say ""Hey the govt is not doing that bad a job"" or ""Hey, it's a shit show out there""!

g2ygx8,The case for Covid-19 cases in India,"Alright, since there’s a lot going on, let’s start with the basics:
A Quick recall: A new virus strain emerges out of the Wuhan Province of China last December, China declares it on Jan 1, then WHO declares it a ‘Public health Emergency’ on 30th January, then a pandemic on 11th March (A Pandemic is rapid spread of a disease amidst a large populace, within a short interval of time, spanning multiple continents).
Mass hysteria follows, as it usually does these days. Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesn’t get even more so.
The name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for that’s reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;

Here’s the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.
Also, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesn’t fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!
Best example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.
Point I am trying to make here is that, that you can’t confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.
India’s share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!
The Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last night’s data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.
Meaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.
Concurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isn’t mere coincidence.
The Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.

The dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japan’s 11.7, Italy’s 6.7, & US’ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:

If we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then we’ll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.

Say out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individuals’ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who haven’t been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested.",Vishuliaris,Coronavirus,False,,True,False,0,0,False,,,0,2020-04-17 22:40:03,13,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2ygx8/the_case_for_covid19_cases_in_india/

g2ct57,A polite request to all Indians here,"I don't know if it is the same situation in other countries, but in India, I have seen A LOT of organisations which have very toxic environments.

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments.

And also when someone voices their opinion in a large gathering, for example, especially this subreddit, it’s not practical to know what opinion offends which person. It’s simply not viable. Furthermore, censoring something one says just because it hurts someone else’s beliefs or feelings can be counterintuitive, as they’ll just be more vocal in raising their opinion.

g3fogm,Mom being inherently biased against muslims. Help me change her views.,"To give it a bit of context (She stays with dad in a tier 3 city with no contact to anyone apart from work friends, I live in a tier 1 city because of job)

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",NewThrowaway543210,AskIndia,False,,True,False,26,0,False,,,0,2020-04-18 15:45:50,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3fogm/mom_being_inherently_biased_against_muslims_help/

g2pd5o,Bollywood Nazis: A Tale of Two Sisters,"Yesterday, Twitter permanently suspended the account of Rangoli Chandel, Kangana Ranaut's sister and manager, for a tweet that was too hateful even for Twitter, the single largest enabler of hate speech after Facebook and Whatsapp.

Following is the text of the tweet, verbatim:

""A Jamati died of Corona when police and doctors went to check their families they were attacked and killed, make these mullas + secular media stand in a line and shoot them dead... F**k history. They may call us Nazis who cares, life is more important than fake image."" [1]

Rangoli Chandel was followed on Twitter by over 100 thousand people. The tweet remained for everyone to see for almost a whole day. It was retweeted 1497 times and liked by over 5600 people.

Last year, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, Kangana Ranaut had said this of Shabana Azmi and Pakistan:

""The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions. Pakistan's ban is not the focus, Pakistan's destruction is."" [2]

Earlier this year, the Indian government awarded Kangana Padma Shri, the country's 4th highest civilian honor. 

Following this latest incident, if not a Padma award, it is entirely plausible that Rangoli could at least snag a BJP ticket in an upcoming election.

And they are not the only ones that have this kind of attitude to the larger population that is Hindu. There are many such Islamic congregations that operate under the same sense of autonomy from the state.

But instead of focusing on those bearded lungi-wallas we should look at the funders of such programs in India. And this is not the only country that is being funded to make its muslims more conservative and Wahabbi. Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, everyone of these countries is prey to this.

Where is all this funding coming from? Follow the money, dammit! Oldest rule in the book when you're investigating a crime.

When will Arknb and the rest -- including the so called Left Media, Wire, Print, NDTV, Hindu -- speak out against Saudi funding for Wahabbi hardline Muslim dogma in our country that has already rotted a big chunk of its population?

g2obqh,Should I really be scared of the delivery executives after what happened today?,"I guess its kind of a CMV. I was thinking about how cooking food requires daily interaction with local grocers for veggies and wanted to compare it with ordering food under lockdown. PS I can do both. 

1. Supposing delivery executives do 15orders a day, they get to interact with 30 different people. A grocer will be interacting daily with suppliers and customers and the count would be much higher.

2. You going to the grocer means interacting directly with a potential carrier(since they are interacting with more people). You meeting a delivery executive should be lower risk because the executive would at max be an intermediate carrier and and 2nd degree.

3. Todays case the employee was a a Box8 employee. I am not sure if they are as strict and vigilant as swiggy or zomato.

4. Ordering meat dishes will always be more nutritious than cooking eggs and veggies provided the cost is affordable.

5. The only con I can think of with delivery executives is that they will be driving to all parts of the city, even potential virus hotspots. You grocer will be in your locality. His suppliers might come from other parts but in this case grocer becomes 2nd degree. The suppliers and customers would also be almost same everyday while for delivery executives they would almost certainly be meeting different people every day.

My mind is biased towards ordering and so I wanted to get some counter arguments and whether my line of thinking is correct here. Currently I order only curry while I make rice/roti at home. This makes me order once or twice in two days.

We weren't allowed to sit in any other placement as we can only participate in placement with a higher package than the ones we already have.

Now I(and some of my friends) have lost my only placement. 
I always had a plan to directly go for a jo after Btech and then decide what to do with my future. Now that that plan got absolutely ruined, what do I do?

Yeah Yeah i know its bad form to downplay corona virus right now.

But if the mortality rate is **0.2%** in **10 - 39** range and **0.4%** in **39-40** range then the overall mortality rate would be about **0.32 - 0.35% in under 50 range.**

Why not let people under 50 to go back to work with the obvious restrictions ....compulsory face mask and gloves ....some social distancing ....safeguards like temperature check ...companies that allow only under 50 years aged employees to work and also implement basic safeguards to be allowed to function after getting permission from authorities etc ...

I mean according to \[govt of india figures\]( [http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes\_of\_death\_2001-03.pdf](http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes_of_death_2001-03.pdf)/ )

In the age group 25-69, the leading causes of death in this age group are:

Cardiovascular diseases (25%), ¾

COPD, asthma, other respiratory (10.2%),

Tuberculosis (10.1%),

Malignant and other neoplasms (9%),

Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions (5.3%),

Digestive diseases (5.1%),

Diarrhoeal diseases (5%)

Unintentional injuries: Other (4.6%),

Intentional self-harm or suicide (3%),

and Malaria (2.8%).

**India** \- **Adult mortality rate** between age 15 and 60

In 2015, **adult mortality rate** for **India** was 31.43 deaths per 100 population.

so even if we end up with 25% of the allowed adult population (0-49 years) infected with corona virus over the next 6 months ....the mortality rate is only 0.35% - which means death toll of 95,000 or 0.007% of population

Keep in mind 90% of corona virus infections are asymptomatic - so only 4-5% of the infected actually end up needing hospitalization.

Ok ....you can shoot me down now and say i am missing the point and have got it all wrong.

I was not interested in it anyway as I hated the course I took with all my heart(Computer Science). I took it as I didn't have much knowledge about ny future after higher secondaries and everyone said taking computer science would land me a job.

I regret this decision more than anything in my life.

I find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. My parents and friends always used to say I have an artistic mind. I draw a lot too, good pictures also.

Then I got into photography, I take a lot of photos and still do. Have won 2-3 local photography contests. But never invested in it because I never got time to do so.

Also I never knew how to get into this photography field? I don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

By photography I mean wildlife, landscape, etc. I wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. I really wont care about the salary very much as atleast I would love what I'm doing. The thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

I need help and advice. Do I need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? Please help me in anyway you can.

g2jv2k,"In India, do we really need Schools, parental supervision for kids after age 10, colleges for courses like Computer Engineering, jobs with less than 40 days vacation a year, Arranged Marriages, stigma against the hookup culture, and expenditure on luxury goods?","Schools - Why do we make such child attend a school where he studies specific subjects that would have no use in the career he chooses for himself? Untill he chooses a profession for himself, why not show him what careers and this world is like  in some kind of Vanity van or exploring bus?

Parental Supervision - Once the kid returns back to home from the school he faces his parents. A lot of parents are not trained to deal with kids. Still these parents advice them, scold, influence and in worst cases, abuse and beat the children. What is the need for a parental supervision after a minimum age like 10?

Colleges - A college for medical science or civil/ mechanical engineering might be necessary. But for computer engineering, what's the need for making a person attend lectures on topic he has already learnt well from Udemy and make him waste 3 years for a course in college that he can cover in just 1.5 years by himself?

Jobs - I have felt a lot of people are frustrated with their jobs. The frustrations can be can be reduced if we give them atleast a 10 day vacation to a peaceful place after every 90 days. Makes it 40 days in a year. Government Jobs have 30. Private jobs give lesser than that. In India, this is even more important as traffic and noise is too much in the cities and people crave for a heaven escape after every few weeks or months. 

Arranged Marriage - Its often difficult for those in a love marriage to keep the love intact for upto 50 years. Imagine how scary it would be for those in an arranged marriage to live together for even 10 years.

Stigma against Hookup Culture - Nations like India are famous for tinder bios like ""Not here for hookups"". Even a lot of parents of girls are against sex before marriage, compelling these girls to meet their boyfriends in secrecy. I don't know why parents do this but I have heard it is done to increase the value and sanctity of their daughter for the groom who comes as the highest bidder with the highest paying job.

g1lmhg,[Please Advice] Reality punched me in the face today.,"Sorry Reddit, this post is going to be long. Please bear with me. Also using a throwaway account for privacy concerns.


This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

She says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

A little background about my family:
We're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
At this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. 

Cut to the question:
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.

I really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. My dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.I have a job now, and I'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from September.

I don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can I do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",throaway-forprivacy,AskIndia,False,,True,False,83,0,False,,,0,2020-04-15 18:49:08,436,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g1lmhg/please_advice_reality_punched_me_in_the_face_today/

g217sw,Did Government and media failed to teach people how the virus spreads and how to avoid it?,"I think lockdown is not a solution to minimise the virus spread. The virus is spread from the water droplets that come out of an infected person when they speak or cough or sneeze. So maintaining enough distance (at least 2m) from people (anyone) is important. Virus stays in air for sometime depending upon the humidity, so wearing mask is important. Virus can show its first symptoms after 5-12 days so don’t neglect social distancing ( this term hardly anyone knows in better way but it is just keeping distance from people of at least about 2m or more) at any cost. Virus can stay on different surface so maintaining personal and surrounding hygiene is important. But no govt official or media is taking an effort to educate people about all this information.

g25qdc,"Series reccomendations, to binge during lockdown","If anyone's interested, ive listed a few shows that maybe not as popular as Money heist, but still awesome. Probably because no over the top ott advertising.     

- The Night Of : About a Pakistani teen in murica who gets convicted for sexual murder. Dark stuff, and there's gritty jail / court drama.     

- The Man in high castle : What if the Axis nations won World war 2. Muricas been divided between fascist japs and Nazi's. Only watch season 1 and maybe 2. Gets dragging after.     

- The Outsider : If you liked It, It chapter 2 etc...the man who wrote them all in the first place wrote another novel in 2018. This ones grounded in reality, yet plays around with the idea of the supernatural.    

- Broadchurch :  David Tennants (Killgrave from JessicaJones) character as a hard boiled grumpy detective with a thick Brit accent (if you're used to him from JJ), and the naturally flowing whodunit story about a murdered child.     

- Sons Of Anarchy : Biker gang that goes running drugs and porn for business. Its a cool show that has family drama - and then Lots of bassassery and violence.    

- True Detective : this is definitely not an underrated show, having achieved cult popularity levels. If not seen it then its a must watch. Lots of hardboiled detective action and a strange grizzly murder


- Ash vs Evil Dead : nothing special, but fun and silly horror. Try watching a few episodes then decide. 

- Fargo: a lot of you guys probably seen this, but still needed mentioning....because its a cool show. The characters each have a lot going for them in terms of the story they add to, in a small town setting.

Bihar government issued made it mandatory to have new pass issued from DM for new lockdown. The order was withdrawn as shown in the circular below as well as news clippings. My father had old pass from 1st part of lockdown since new one wasn't issued due to holiday yesterday and order being withdrawn by the government. Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.
